Rose Rosette Virus (genus Emaraviridae) is the most devastating disease of roses. Rose Rosette Virus (RRV) creates witches brooms, rosetting, deforms flowers, increases prickle density, elongates shoots, reddens of plant tissues, causes dieback and ultimately plant death. RRV is spread by a microscopic eriophyid mite known as *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* Keifer (Trombidiformes: Eriophyidae). Few management options are available: Current mite control is achieved by removing infected roses and frequent pesticide applications. Growers are interested in alternative and less expensive management options to combat *P. fructiphilus* and RRV. Predatory mites have potential to fulfill this need: mites from the family Phytoseiidae are being investigated as biocontrol agents for the management of *P. fructiphilus*. Preliminary data suggest that the phytoseiid mite *Amblyseius swirskii* Athias-Henriot (Mesostigmata: Phytoseiidae) orients itself towards volatiles of RRV-infected roses. This attraction may have synergistic effects for *P. fructiphilus* control. *A. swirskii* and three other commercially-available phytoseiid mites will be tested in olfactometer choice tests to identify specific volatile compounds which may be causing this behavior. Findings will help to develop chemical lures and promote depredation on *P. fructiphilus* in Rose Rosette-infected roses. This research will contribute a biocontrol option for the management of *P. fructiphilus* in southern Georgia and northern Florida.
