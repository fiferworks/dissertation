Rose Rosette Virus (genus Emaraviridae) is the most devastating disease of roses. Rose Rosette Virus (RRV) creates witches brooms, rosetting, deforms flowers, increases prickle density, elongates shoots, reddens of plant tissues, causes dieback and ultimately plant death. RRV is spread by a microscopic eriophyid mite known as Phyllocoptes fructiphilus Keifer (Trombidiformes: Eriophyidae). Few management options are available: Current mite control is achieved by removing infected roses and frequent pesticide applications. Growers are interested in alternative and less expensive management options to combat P. fructiphilus and RRV. Aggressive pruning was tested for its ability to reduce populations of P. fructiphilus. Mites from the family Phytoseiidae are being investigated as biocontrol agents for the management of P. fructiphilus. A survey of mites on roses was conducted in northern Florida to search for P. fructiphilus, RRD and/or predatory mites. Preliminary data suggest that the phytoseiid mite Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot (Mesostigmata: Phytoseiidae) orients itself towards volatiles of RRV-infected roses. This attraction may have synergistic effects for *P. fructiphilus control. A. swirskii was tested in olfactometer choice tests to identify specific volatile compounds which may cause this behavior. Low levels of Methyl Salicylate found in RRV-infected roses suggest that the virus interferes with the rose's ability to defend itself against the pathogen. A avoid this negative feedback loop is to induce Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) before pathogen introduction, a procedure which could increase the rose's resistance to RRV. Considering this knowledge, we collaborated with the University of Georgia in to test how SAR-induction might protect roses from P. fructiphilus and/or RRD. Acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) is a benzothiadiazole, a SAR-inducing chemical which works like Salicylic Acid to induce plant defenses against viruses, bacteria, and fungal infection. ASM application also has shown chitinase activity in roses, and some studies have shown that the hypersensitive response and SAR interfere with the ability of eriophyoid mites to feed or grow on induced plants. A remaining concern is that SAR-induction may harm predatory mites via direct and indirect effects of SAR-induction. We conducted several field studies from 2018-2021 in order to test the integration of predatory mites with SAR. This research will contribute a biocontrol option for the management of P. fructiphilus in southern Georgia and northern Florida. We describe the first detection of orchid fleck virus (OFV) infecting three unreported hosts: Liriope muscari, cv. 'Gigantea' (Decaisne) Bailey, Ophiopogon intermedius Don and Aspidistra elatior Blume (Asparagaceae: Nolinoidaea) in Leon and Alachua Counties, FL. The orchid-infecting subgroup (Orc) of OFV infects over 50 plant species belonging to the plant families Orchidaceae, Asparagaceae (Nolinoidaea), and causes citrus leprosis disease in Citrus (Rutaceae). The only known vectors of OFV-Orc are the flat mites, Brevipalpus californicus (Banks) sensu lato (Trombidiformes: Tenuipalpidae). Florida has various plants in the landscape which Brevipalpus spp. feed on, which are susceptible to infection by OFV-Orc. Chlorotic ringspots and flecking were seen affecting Liriopogons (Liriope and Ophiopogon spp.) in Leon County, FL. Nearby A. elatior also appeared chlorotic. Local diagnostics returned negative for common plant pathogens, therefore new samples were sent to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) and USDA-ARS for identification. Two orchid-infecting strains of OFV were detected via combinations of conventional RT-PCR, RT-qPCR, Sanger sequencing and High Throughput Sequencing (HTS). Amplicons shared 98\% nucleotide identity with OFV-Orc1 and OFV-Orc2 RNA2 genome sequences available in NCBI GenBank. Coinfections were detected in each county, but single strains of OFV-Orc were detected in L. muscari (Alachua, OFV-Orc2) and A. elatior (Leon, OFV-Orc1). Three potential mite vectors were identified via cryo-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM): Brevipalpus californicus (Banks) sensu lato, B. obovatus Donnadieu, and B. confusus Baker. In conclusion, OFV orchid strains are present in northern Florida, representing a risk for susceptible plants in the southeastern US.
