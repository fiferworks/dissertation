Rose Rosette Virus (genus Emaraviridae) is the most devastating disease of roses. Rose Rosette Virus (RRV) creates witches brooms, rosetting, deforms flowers, increases prickle density, elongates shoots, reddens of plant tissues, causes dieback and ultimately plant death. RRV is spread by a microscopic eriophyid mite known as *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* Keifer (Trombidiformes: Eriophyidae). Few management options are available: Current mite control is achieved by removing infected roses and frequent pesticide applications. Growers are interested in alternative and less expensive management options to combat *P. fructiphilus* and RRV. Predatory mites have potential to fulfill this need: mites from the family Phytoseiidae are being investigated as biocontrol agents for the management of *P. fructiphilus*. Preliminary data suggest that the phytoseiid mite *Amblyseius swirskii* Athias-Henriot (Mesostigmata: Phytoseiidae) orients itself towards volatiles of RRV-infected roses. This attraction may have synergistic effects for *P. fructiphilus* control. *A. swirskii* and three other commercially-available phytoseiid mites will be tested in olfactometer choice tests to identify specific volatile compounds which may be causing this behavior. Findings will help to develop chemical lures and promote depredation on *P. fructiphilus* in Rose Rosette-infected roses. This research will contribute a biocontrol option for the management of *P. fructiphilus* in southern Georgia and northern Florida. We describe the first detection of orchid fleck virus (OFV) infecting three unreported hosts: *Liriope muscari*, cv. 'Gigantea' (Decaisne) Bailey, *Ophiopogon intermedius* Don and *Aspidistra elatior* Blume (Asparagaceae: Nolinoidaea) in Leon and Alachua Counties, FL. The orchid-infecting subgroup (Orc) of OFV infects over 50 plant species belonging to the plant families Orchidaceae, Asparagaceae (Nolinoidaea), and causes citrus leprosis disease in *Citrus* (Rutaceae). The only known vectors of OFV-Orc are the flat mites, *Brevipalpus californicus* (Banks) *sensu lato* (Trombidiformes: Tenuipalpidae). Florida has various plants in the landscape which *Brevipalpus* spp. feed on, which are susceptible to infection by OFV-Orc. Chlorotic ringspots and flecking were seen affecting Liriopogons (*Liriope* and *Ophiopogon* spp.) in Leon County, FL. Nearby *A. elatior* also appeared chlorotic. Local diagnostics returned negative for common plant pathogens, therefore new samples were sent to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) and USDA-ARS for identification. Two orchid-infecting strains of OFV were detected via combinations of conventional RT-PCR, RT-qPCR, Sanger sequencing and High Throughput Sequencing (HTS). Amplicons shared 98\% nucleotide identity with OFV-Orc1 and OFV-Orc2 RNA2 genome sequences available in NCBI GenBank. Coinfections were detected in each county, but single strains of OFV-Orc were detected in *L. muscari* (Alachua, OFV-Orc2) and *A. elatior* (Leon, OFV-Orc1). Three potential mite vectors were identified via cryo-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM): *Brevipalpus californicus* (Banks) sensu lato, *B. obovatus* Donnadieu, and *B. confusus* Baker. In conclusion, OFV orchid strains are present in northern Florida, representing a risk for susceptible plants in the southeastern US.
