*Rose rosette emaravirus* (RRV) is the most devastating disease of roses, and is the causal agent of Rose Rosette Disease (RRD). Roses infected with RRD produce witches brooms, rosetting, deformed flowers, increased prickle density, elongated shoots, reddened plant tissues, dieback and ultimately plant death. Few management options are available: Current mite control is achieved by removing infected roses and frequent pesticide applications. Growers are interested in alternative and less expensive management options to combat *P. fructiphilus* and RRV. Surveys from 2019-2021 were conducted along an east-west transect in northern Florida, searching for RRD, *P. fructiphilus*, predatory mites, and other mites on roses in the landscape. As a result of these surveys, *P. fructiphilus* were detected for the first time in the state, but no RRD was detected. *P. fructiphilus* represents a potential threat to the Florida rose industry if RRD becomes established.

We also describe the first detection of *Orchid fleck dichorhavirus* (OFV) infecting three unreported ornamental hosts: *Liriope muscari*, cv. 'Gigantea' (Decaisne) Bailey, *Ophiopogon intermedius* Don and *Aspidistra elatior* Blume (Asparagaceae: Nolinoidaea) in Leon and Alachua Counties, FL. The orchid-infecting subgroup (Orc) of OFV infects over 50 plant species belonging to the plant families Orchidaceae, Asparagaceae (Nolinoidaea), and causes citrus leprosis disease in Citrus (Rutaceae). The only known vectors of OFV-Orc are the flat mites, *Brevipalpus californicus* (Banks) *sensu lato* (Trombidiformes: Tenuipalpidae). Chlorotic ringspots and flecking were seen affecting Liriopogons (*Liriope* and *Ophiopogon* spp.) in Leon County, FL. Nearby A. elatior also appeared chlorotic. Local diagnostics returned negative for common plant pathogens, therefore new samples were sent to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) and USDA-ARS for identification. Two orchid-infecting strains of OFV were detected via combinations of conventional RT-PCR, RT-qPCR, Sanger sequencing and High Throughput Sequencing (HTS). Amplicons shared 98\% nucleotide identity with OFV-Orc1 and OFV-Orc2 RNA2 genome sequences available in NCBI GenBank. Coinfections were detected in each county, but single strains of OFV-Orc were detected in L. muscari (Alachua, OFV-Orc2) and A. elatior (Leon, OFV-Orc1). Three potential mite vectors were identified via cryo-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM): *B. californicus s. l,*, *B. obovatus* Donnadieu, and *B. confusus Baker*. Florida has various plants in the landscape which *Brevipalpus* spp. feed on, which are susceptible to infection by OFV-Orc. In conclusion, OFV orchid strains are present in northern Florida, representing a risk for susceptible plants in the southeastern US.
