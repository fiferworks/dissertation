# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

I would like to give special thanks for the Tallahassee Museum and their patience, cooperation, and support with collecting plant samples. I am grateful for the USDA-APHIS PPQ Beltsville laboratory for their support in the identification and confirmation OFV isolates, as well as *Brevipalpus* mite identification at the USDA-ARS. I also want to thank Drs. Sam Bolton, FDACS and Aline Tassi, Univ. of Sao Paulo, Brazil for checking the mites we have sent for species validation. Furthermore, I am grateful for Dr. Marc S. Frank's identification of the Liriopogons collected. I am especially indebted to the late Dr. Gary Bauchan for his contributions to this study and the field of acarology, he will be greatly missed. This research was partly funded by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project FLA-NFC-005607 and USDA-AFRI-CPPM 2017-70006-27268. Funds were also contributed by The Florida Nursery, Growers and Landscape Association's (FNGLA) Endowed Research Funds.
