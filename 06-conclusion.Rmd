# CONCLUSIONS: INVASIVE MITES ARE AN INCREASINGLY LARGE PROBLEM FOR FLORIDA

## Main Findings

The principal findings of our experiments are: 

1. *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* is present in multiple cities in northern Florida
1. The predatory mite *Amblyseius swirskii* is attracted to roses infected with Rose Rosette Disease (RRD)
1. Infected roses have higher levels of defense-related terpenes, including \textgamma-Muurolene, \textbeta-Caryophyllene, and D-Limonene, some of which may be attractive to *A. swirskii*
1. ASM-treated plants had higher similarity in their Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) profiles to one another than to the VOCs released from healthy or RRV-infected plants
1. Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) via acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) does not appear to significantly reduce populations of *P. fructiphilus*
1. Preliminary evidence that *P. fructiphilus* populations may be reduced by spirotetramat applications, or possibly heavy pruning when RRD is not present
1. Orchid Fleck Virus (OFV) is present in common ornamental groundcover plants in Florida. 
1. *Brevipalpus californicus* *sensu lato*, a known vector of OFV, were found on OFV-infected plants


## Invasive Species Continue to be a Problem

The aim of our research was to address the emerging problems caused by the recent invasions of mites and the plant viruses they vector to northern Florida.

Florida is a hotspot for invasive species in the mainland US, due to a combination of its unique geography, climate, rapid development and a multitude of invasion pathways [@Simberloff1997; @Williams2007; @Card2018]. Invasive species are often harmful to ecosystem services and modify ecosystems to the detriment of native species [@Gordon1998]. Efforts to manage invasive species costs the state of Florida ~$45M each year [@Hiatt2019]. Many Florida programs have been developed to raise public awareness about the threats of invasive species, as well as encouraging the reporting of invasive species by the public [@Wallace2016]. *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus*, *Rose rosette emaravirus*, and *Orchid fleck dichorhavirus* all represent yet another chapter in the story of Florida invasion ecology. These organisms have a high possibility of becoming established invasive species in Florida if preventative actions are not taken. 


Invasive species are thought to mainly disperse through short distances via local spread around established focal populations (diffusive dispersal), while long-distance jumps are more often due to human movements [@Garnas2016; @Suarez2001; @Novak2001; @Higgins1999; @Ibrahim1996].

A further examination of population dynamics, genetic variation and/or spatial structure of mite populations should provide evidence for which pathways of introduction are most prevalent [@Boubou2012; @Boubou2010; @Navia2005; @Williams2007].

The ease of arthropod movement is thought to have been generally underestimated in the past [@Garnas2016].

In the last three years our lab has discovered recent introductions of two invasive of mite-virus-pathosystems previously unreported in Florida. The new invasive mite (*P. fructiphilus*) and the new mite-vectored virus (OFV) were both encountered on ornamental plants commonly planted in Florida landscapes.

Eriophyoid mites are known to disperse aerially over a hundred meters away from infested areas [@Bergh1997], 

Eriophyids have also been found to move on contaminated clothing and equipment [@Duffner2001].


On the other hand, the current invasions of *P. fructiphilus* may have been introduced through their natural means of dispersal over time. The short distances between mite infested roses in Georgia, Alabama and Florida suggest the possibility of multiple routes of introduction, but the mechanisms of dispersal require further investigation for *P. fructiphilus*. 

In addition, the movements of plant pathogens such as RRD is thought to be partially driven by socioeconomic factors and the movement of plants by people [@Nelson2015; @Katsiani2020]. Inspections and quarantines of mite-infested roses by wholesalers and larger growers is predicted to slow the spread of plant pathogen epidemics [@Nelson2015].



This is likely an unfortunate byproduct of the global plant trade and the inadvertent introduction of invasive species [@Chapman2017; @Westphal2007]. Another risk factor for the spread of RRV is the movement of plants and their pathogens via the movement of infected materials and seed through trade networks [@Liebhold2012; @Pautasso2014; @Schoebel2014; @MoslonkaLefebvre2011; @Hulme2008; @Westphal2007; @Jeger2007]. Studies and simulations of seed networks have revealed that larger seed companies and operations have greater potential to spread plant pathogens than informal seed systems run by smaller entities [@Coomes2015; @Biemond2013]. This is partially due to their greater ability to spread infected plant materials at a larger scale than smaller trade systems [@Biemond2013]. Similarly, @Nelson2015 simulated the effects of quarantines on preventing the spread of a pathogen through an idealized plant trade network. In their simulations, they found that increasing the number of growers and wholesalers generally an increased number of infections, but that more inspections decreased the chances of infection. They concluded that were most likely to be prevented via quarantine of growers and wholesalers of plants [@Nelson2015].
