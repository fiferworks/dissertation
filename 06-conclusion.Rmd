# CONCLUSIONS: INVASIVE MITES ARE AN INCREASINGLY LARGE PROBLEM FOR FLORIDA

The principal findings of these trials are: 

1. *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* is present in multiple cities in northern Florida
1. *P. fructiphilus* populations may be reduced by heavy pruning
1. The predatory mite *Amblyseius swirskii* is attracted to roses infected with Rose Rosette Disease (RRD)
1. Infected roses have higher levels of defense-related terpenes, including \textgamma-Muurolene, \textbeta-Caryophyllene, and D-Limonene
1. ASM-treated plants had similar more profiles to one another than to the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) released from healthy or RRD-infected plants
1. Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) via acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) does not appear to significantly reduce populations of *P. fructiphilus*
1. The integrated pest management treatments we tested were not very efficient for controlling populations of *P. fructiphilus*
1. Orchid Fleck Virus (OFV) is present in ornamental groundcover plants in Florida. the vector of OFV (*Brevipalpus californicus*) is present as well


## Invasive mites are a problem in Florida

We encountered two invasive mite species associated with plant viruses in the last three years. This is likely an unfortunate byproduct of the plant trade.
