# CONCLUSIONS: INVASIVE MITES ARE AN INCREASINGLY LARGE PROBLEM FOR FLORIDA
## Invasive Species are a Problem in Florida

The aim of our research was to address the emerging problems caused by the recent invasions of mites and the plant viruses they vector to northern Florida. Florida is a hotspot for invasive species in the mainland US, due to a combination of its unique geography, climate, rapid development and a multitude of invasion pathways [@Simberloff1997; @Williams2007; @Card2018]. Invasive species are often harmful to ecosystem services and modify ecosystems to the detriment of native species [@Gordon1998]. Efforts to manage invasive species costs the state of Florida ~$45M each year [@Hiatt2019]. Many Florida programs have been developed to raise public awareness about the threats of invasive species, as well as encouraging the reporting of invasive species by the public [@Wallace2016]. *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus*, Rose Rosette Disease, and Orchid Fleck Virus all represent yet another chapter in the story of Florida invasion ecology. These organisms have a high possibility of becoming established invasive species in Florida if preventative actions are not taken. Our research was designed to address two of the main issues of controlling *P. fructiphilus*: early detection and integrated pest management of the mite vector.

## Main Findings
The principal findings of our experiments are: 

1. *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* is present in multiple cities in northern Florida
1. The predatory mite *Amblyseius swirskii* is attracted to roses infected with Rose Rosette Disease (RRD)
1. Infected roses have higher levels of defense-related terpenes, including \textgamma-Muurolene, \textbeta-Caryophyllene, and D-Limonene, some of which may be attractive to *A. swirskii*
1. ASM-treated plants had more similar profiles to one another than to the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) released from healthy or RRV-infected plants
1. Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) via acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) does not appear to significantly reduce populations of *P. fructiphilus*
1. *P. fructiphilus* populations may be reduced by spirotetramat applications, or possibly heavy pruning
1. Orchid Fleck Virus (OFV) is present in ornamental groundcover plants in Florida. the vector of OFV (*Brevipalpus californicus*, *sensu lato*) is present as well

We encountered two invasive mite species associated with plant viruses in the last three years. This is likely an unfortunate byproduct of the plant trade and the [@Chapman2017].
