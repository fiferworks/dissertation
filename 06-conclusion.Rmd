# CONCLUSIONS: INVASIVE MITES ARE AN INCREASINGLY LARGE PROBLEM FOR FLORIDA
## Invasive Species Continue to be a Problem

The aim of our research was to address the emerging problems caused by the recent invasions of mites and the plant viruses they vector to northern Florida. Florida is a hotspot for invasive species in the mainland US, due to a combination of its unique geography, climate, rapid development and a multitude of invasion pathways [@Simberloff1997; @Williams2007; @Card2018]. Invasive species are often harmful to ecosystem services and modify ecosystems to the detriment of native species [@Gordon1998]. Efforts to manage invasive species costs the state of Florida ~$45M each year [@Hiatt2019]. Many Florida programs have been developed to raise public awareness about the threats of invasive species, as well as encouraging the reporting of invasive species by the public [@Wallace2016]. *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus*, *Rose rosette emaravirus*, and *Orchid fleck dichorhavirus* all represent yet another chapter in the story of Florida invasion ecology. These organisms have a high possibility of becoming established invasive species in Florida if preventative actions are not taken. 

## Main Findings
The principal findings of our experiments are: 

1. *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* is present in multiple cities in northern Florida
1. The predatory mite *Amblyseius swirskii* is attracted to roses infected with Rose Rosette Disease (RRD)
1. Infected roses have higher levels of defense-related terpenes, including \textgamma-Muurolene, \textbeta-Caryophyllene, and D-Limonene, some of which may be attractive to *A. swirskii*
1. ASM-treated plants had more similar profiles to one another than to the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) released from healthy or RRV-infected plants
1. Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) via acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) does not appear to significantly reduce populations of *P. fructiphilus*
1. *P. fructiphilus* populations may be reduced by spirotetramat applications, or possibly heavy pruning
1. Orchid Fleck Virus (OFV) is present in ornamental groundcover plants in Florida. the vector of OFV (*Brevipalpus californicus*, *sensu lato*) is present as well


## Future Areas of Study
We encountered two invasive mite species associated with plant viruses in the last three years. This is likely an unfortunate byproduct of the global plant trade and the inadvertent introduction of invasive species [@Chapman2017; @Westphal2007]. Another risk factor for the spread of RRV is the movement of plants and their pathogens via the movement of infected materials and seed through trade networks [@Liebhold2012; @Pautasso2014; @Schoebel2014; @MoslonkaLefebvre2011; @Hulme2008; @Westphal2007; @Jeger2007]. Studies and simulations of seed networks have revealed that larger seed companies and operations have greater potential to spread plant pathogens than informal seed systems run by smaller entities [@Coomes2015; @Biemond2013]. This is partially due to their greater ability to spread infected plant materials at a larger scale than smaller trade systems [@Biemond2013]. Similarly, @Nelson2015 simulated the effects of quarantines on preventing the spread of a pathogen through an idealized plant trade network. In their simulations, they found that increasing the number of growers and wholesalers generally an increased number of infections, but that more inspections decreased the chances of infection. They concluded that were most likely to be prevented via quarantine of growers and wholesalers of plants [@Nelson2015].
