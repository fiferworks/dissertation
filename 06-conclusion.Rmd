# CONCLUSIONS: INVASIVE MITES ARE AN INCREASINGLY LARGE PROBLEM FOR FLORIDA
## Invasive species are a problem in Florida

The aim of our research was to address the emerging problems caused by the recent invasions of mites and the plant viruses they vector to northern Florida. Florida is a hotspot for invasive species in the mainland US, due to a combination of its unique geography, climate, rapid development and a multitude of invasion pathways [@Simberloff1997; @Williams2007; @Card2018]. Efforts to manage invasive species costs the state of Florida ~$45M each year [@Hiatt2019].



Florida programs have been developed to encourage reporting invasive species by the public [@Wallace2016]

Invasive species are often harmful to ecosystem services and modify ecosystems to the detriment of native species [@Gordon1998].

## Main findings

The principal findings of these trials are: 

1. *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* is present in multiple cities in northern Florida
1. *P. fructiphilus* populations may be reduced by heavy pruning
1. The predatory mite *Amblyseius swirskii* is attracted to roses infected with Rose Rosette Disease (RRD)
1. Infected roses have higher levels of defense-related terpenes, including \textgamma-Muurolene, \textbeta-Caryophyllene, and D-Limonene
1. ASM-treated plants had similar more profiles to one another than to the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) released from healthy or RRD-infected plants
1. Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) via acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) does not appear to significantly reduce populations of *P. fructiphilus*
1. The integrated pest management treatments we tested were not very efficient for controlling populations of *P. fructiphilus*
1. Orchid Fleck Virus (OFV) is present in ornamental groundcover plants in Florida. the vector of OFV (*Brevipalpus californicus*) is present as well


We encountered two invasive mite species associated with plant viruses in the last three years. This is likely an unfortunate byproduct of the plant trade.
