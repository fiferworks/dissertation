# 2. Objective 1: Survey for the invasive mite *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus*, Rose Rosette Virus (RRV), and wild predatory mites in northern Florida {#survey}

## 2.1 *P. fructiphilus* detection in Northern Florida {#survey-nfl}

#### 2.1.1 Problem Statement
Rose Rosette Virus (RRV), the casual agent of Rose Rosette Disease (RRD) and *P. fructiphilus* Kiefer invaded the southeastern United States on the multiflora rose, *R. multiflora* (Thunb) as it spread its range towards the coast [@Amrine2002; @Otero-Colina2018]. RRD is present throughout the US, including Decatur County, GA, near the Florida border (*`r citef("eddmaps")`*), [@EDDMapS2019].

Areas in green are counties where RRD has been reported.")`

In 2018, a group of researchers conducted a series of surveys for *P. fructiphilus* and RRD in the southeastern United States [@Solo2018]. They encountered *P. fructiphilus* in Thomas County and Lowndes County, (*`r citef("Solo2018")`*), [@Solo2018], less than 20 miles from the northern border of Florida.

Unfortunately, these surveys did not include Florida (see *`r citef("Solo2018")`*), [@Solo2018]. 

In early 2019, a survey of predatory mites on roses found eriphyoid mites in samples obtained while surveying roses in Leon County, Florida. The mites were sent to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services - Department of Plant Industry (FDACS-DPI) and were all identified as *P. fructiphilus* by Dr. Sam Bolton. To date, none of these roses have shown signs or symptoms of RDD and none of these plants have tested positive for presence of the virus.

#### 2.1.2 First report of *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* in Florida

*Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* is a microscopic plant-feeding eriophyid mite. Eriophyoid mites are very host specific [@Skoracka2009; @Oldfield1996c] and *P. fructiphilus* only feeds on plants in the genus *Rosa* [@Amrine1996]. *P. fructiphilus* is the vector of Rose Rosette Virus (RRV). RRV infection is commonly associated with the following symptoms: witches’ brooms/rosetting, deformed flowers, increased prickle density, elongated shoots, reddened leaves and stems, and increased die-back
which ultimately kills the rose host [@Amrine1996]. This disease is known as Rose Rosette Disease (RRD). and is the most serious disease of roses, creating millions of dollars of losses for growers. Rose Rosette Disease and the mite have invaded the southeastern united states as they followed the range expansion of the non-native *Rosa multiflora* (Thunb) towards the coast [@Amrine2002; @Otero-Colina2018].

In 2018 we began a series of surveys along the borders of northern Florida and southern Georgia

A key part of *P. fructiphilus* control is vector and disease monitoring. Previous surveys of the southeastern United States did not survey for *P. fructiphilus* in Florida, but our own surveys have since detected *P. fructiphilus* in northern Florida (unpublished). The virus was previously detected independently of the mite vector previously as well [@Babu2014], so it is possible that *P. fructiphilus* and/or RRV are present in other parts of the state. We propose a survey of mites on roses in Florida to estimate the distribution and populations of *P. fructiphilus*, as well as to determinie RRV incidence. Doing so will provide us with insight into the epidemiology of *P. fructiphilus* and RRV. 

An additional value of rose surveys will be detecting other mites present on roses: there are many species of predatory phytoseiid mites present in Florida with potential to control agricultural pests such as *P. fructiphilus*. Native predatory mites sometimes have an advantage for bio-control because native mites have adapted to the environment where they will be released [@Gerson2014]. Besides predatory mites, we also may encounter other alternative vectors of RRV or different mite species of concern which have not yet been reported in Florida.

An IPM approach uses as many compatible methods of control as is possible. By investigating early detection, bio-control, and epidemiology, we hope to find methods to understand and control the spread of *P. fructiphilius* and RRV.

Cities with populations over 1,000 will be visited along this route and cuttings will be taken from various roses in each city. Rose species, symptoms and coordinates will be recorded to map out sites which have *P. fructiphilus* or possibly Rose Rosette Disease.

Rose tissue samples were taken from the periphery of various roses throughout Leon and Gadsden counties as well as surrounding regions. Rose tissues sampled included a mixture of flowers, fruits, buds and short lengths of rose cane, trimmed with bypass pruners and stored in quart sized plastic baggies. Pruners were sanitized with 70% ethanol between cuts. Rose species and coordinates were recorded to map out sites which had predatory mites, *P. fructiphilus*, or possibly RRD.

Data will be collected monthly for two years:
Sampling will be focused on the flowering tips of roses and include a mixture of flowers, fruits, buds, and short lengths of rose cane. Samples will be trimmed with bypass pruners which are routinely sanitized with 70% ethanol between cuts. Samples will be stored in 500 mL wide-mouthed Polyethene bottles (Nalgene) with ~10 mL of 95\% ethanol and shaken to coat the rose tissues for preservation.

Samples will be processed using a washing method derived from @Monfreda2007: The sampling bottles with ethanol and rose tissues will be vigorously shaken to dislodge any mites, then the ethanol poured over a stack of sieves with decreasing screen sizes: 180 μm, 53 μm, and 25 μm. The bottle and rose pieces will be further rinsed with 95\% ethanol over the sieve stack to dislodge any remaining mites. The 53 μm and 25 μm sieves will be processed separately; the 53 μm sieve retains larger mites while the 25 μm sieve retainS smaller mites, including *P. fructiphilus*. The sieves will then be backwashed from the underside of their screen with a 95\% ethanol-filled wash bottle, starting from the highest point of a sieve and working to the bottom to flush any trapped debris and mites into a 50 mL centrifuge tube for storage and future observation. Samples will be observed under a dissecting microscope. Mites found among the plant debris will be siphoned off with a glass pipette and subsequently stored in micro-centrifuge containers with 95% ethanol as a preservative. Select specimens from each sample will be made into prepared microscope slides. Mites will be cleared and mounted using the methods of @Faraji2008: mites will be cleared and stained with Faraji and Bakker's modified clearing solution and heated on a hot plate until clear, then slide mounted with an iodine-modified Hoyer’s slide mounting media (Hempstead Halide, Inc., Galveston, Texas, USA). Slides will be dried at 90 °C, then a ring of Red Glyptal (brand info) will be painted over the edges of the coverslip to seal the slide. 

A subset of 5 eriophyid samples each month will be selected for molecular testing using the methods described in @Druciarek2019 to verify mite species identity and to insure no RRV presence within those mites. A subset of mite species also be confirmed with the acarologist, Dr. Sam Bolton of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) to ensure accuracy.

If any plants show symptoms of RRD, samples will be taken and tested by the Plant Disease Diagnostic Clinic at the NFREC using the methods of @Babu2016, @Babu2017a, and/or @Babu2017b.


Rose samples were processed using a washing method derived from @Monfreda2007: cut roses were soaked in a 500 mL beaker with a solution of 1:1 bleach:water with few drops of dishwasher detergent. The solution was stirred vigorously with a glass rod to dislodge any mites. This solution was then poured over a stack of sieves with decreasing screen sizes: 180 \si{\micro\metre}, 53 \si{\micro\metre} and 25 \si{\micro\metre}.
The beaker and rose pieces were further rinsed with tap water over the sieve stack to knock off any remaining mites. The 25 \si{\micro\metre} sieve screen traps mites which are the size of *P. fructiphilus*. This sieve was then backwashed from the underside of the screen with a water-filled wash bottle, starting from the highest point of the sieve and working to the bottom of the sieve to flush the trapped debris into a 50 ml centrifuge tube for storage and future observation. Samples were observed under a dissecting microscope. Mites found among the plant debris were siphoned off with a glass pipette and subsequently stored in micro-centrifuge containers filled with 95% ethanol as a preservative. Select specimens were mounted directly into Hoyer's slide mountant (Hempstead Halide, Inc. Galveston, TX), dried at 90&deg;C, then ringed with nail polish. 

On February 14, 2019, we found a total of 42 eriophyid mites from six samples obtained while surveying roses in Leon County, Florida. (see *`r citef("sidemaps")`A*) The mites were sent to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services - Department of Plant Industry (FDACS-DPI) and were all identified as *P. fructiphilus* using the keys provided in [@Baker1996]. The roses did not show signs or symptoms of RDD. These roses were tested for RRV with RT-qPCR and Reverse Transcription Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RT-RPA) [@Babu2016; @Babu2017a]. However, none of the plants infested with *P. fructiphilus* were positive for RRV.

On July 16th we conducted an additional survey of 33 roses near the initial site of discovery, including the rose sites where P. fructiphilus were originally detected. (see *`r citef("sidemaps")`B*), Each sample contained more than 50 eriophyid mites, with some samples containing over 300 mites. We compared the samples collected during February and July with a paired t-test and we found a significant increase in *P. fructiphilus* population between the two sampling dates: p-value = 0.001, α = 0.05, df = 4. A subsample of these mites were slide mounted and subsequently confirmed as *P. fructiphilus*. Additional rose samples were tested for RRV by RT-qPCR, but no virus was detected.

This is the first record for *P. fructiphilus* in Florida. More importantly, RRV is currently not established in Florida. None of the mite-infested roses had symptoms of RRD and none were positive for RRV. However, the presence of *P. fructiphilus*, along with past detections of RRV in Florida warrants increased monitoring for the mite and virus in Florida. There is a critical need to develop methods to manage *P. fructiphilus* and RRV, or the US rose industry stands to lose millions on mite control.

#### 2.1.3 Proposal: a series of surveys for *P. fructiphilus* and Rose Rosette Disease in northern Florida

A key part of controlling the spread of *P. fructiphilus* is mite and disease monitoring. We propose an expanded survey of mites on roses in Florida to estimate the populations and distribution of *P. fructiphilus*, as well as to detect if Rose Rosette Disease is present. Doing so will provide us with insight into the patterns of how *P. fructiphilus* and RRD spread.

An additional value of rose surveys will be detecting other mites present on roses: there are many species of mites present in Florida with potential to control agricultural pests such as *P. fructiphilus*. Native predatory mites sometimes have an advantage for bio-control because native mites have adapted to the environment where they will be released. Besides predatory mites, we also may encounter other vectors of RRD or different mite species of concern which have not yet been reported in Florida.


#### 2.1.4 Materials & Methods

A survey of roses in the landscape was conducted following a transect of northern Florida from west to east, Pensacola to Jacksonville. Cities with populations over 1,000 were visited along this route and cuttings were taken from various roses in each city. Rose cultivar/species, sun exposure and GPS coordinates were recorded to map out sites which had predatory mites, eriophyid mites, or possibly symptoms of Rose Rosette Disease. Rose tissue samples were taken from the periphery of various roses in the landscape; sampling was focused on the flowering tips of roses and included a mixture of flowers, fruits, buds, and short lengths of rose cane. Samples were trimmed with bypass pruners which were routinely sanitized with 70% ethanol between cuts. Samples were stored in 500 mL Nalgene™ Wide-Mouth Polypropylene Copolymer bottles (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with ~10 mL of 95\% ethanol. The rose samples then were gently shaken to coat the rose tissues sampled with ethanol. Doing so made sure that the sampled mites were killed and acted to preserve both mites and rose tissues until samples could be processed further and checked for mites.

Samples were processed using a washing method derived from @Monfreda2007 used to detect eriphyoid mites such as *P. fructiphilius*: The sampling bottles with ethanol and rose tissues were vigorously shaken to dislodge any mites, then the ethanol in the container was poured over a stack of sieves with decreasing screen sizes: 180 \si{\micro\metre}, 53 \si{\micro\metre}, and 25 \si{\micro\metre}. The bottle and rose pieces were then further rinsed with 95\% ethanol over the sieve stack to dislodge any remaining mites. The 53 \si{\micro\metre} and 25 \si{\micro\metre} sieves were processed separately; the 53 \si{\micro\metre} sieve retained larger mites while the 25 \si{\micro\metre} sieve retained smaller mites, including *P. fructiphilus*. The sieves were then backwashed from the underside of their screen with a 95\% ethanol-filled wash bottle, starting from the highest point of a sieve and working to the bottom to flush any trapped debris and mites into a 50 mL centrifuge tube for storage and future observations.

The ethanol solutions of mites and plant debris were allowed to settle until excess ethanol could be siphoned off, allowing us to then pour this concentrated plant-mite mixture into a thin, small petri dishes to be observed under a dissecting microscope. Mites found among the plant debris were counted, then siphoned off with a glass pipette and subsequently stored in micro-centrifuge containers with 95% ethanol as a preservative. 5-10 specimens from each sample were made into prepared microscope slides: Mites were cleared and mounted using the methods of @Faraji2008: mites were simultaneously cleared and stained with Faraji and Bakker's modified clearing solution and heated on a hot plate until the specimens were clear. Subsequently these mites were moved with an eyelash tool into an iodine-modified Hoyer’s slide mounting media (Hempstead Halide®, Inc., Galveston, Texas, USA), underneath a 12 mm glass coverslip. The prepared slide was then dried at 90 °C before sealing the slide by painting a ring of alkyd insulating enamel (Red Glyptal® 1201, Chelsea, MA, USA) over the edges of the coverslip to seal the slide, to protect it from damage by air incursion and moisture. These slides could then be observed under a compound microscope with phase-contrast objectives to identify the mite families and species if necessary.

A subset of up to 10 samples per site will be selected for molecular testing using the methods described in @Druciarek2019 for determining mite species identity and RRV presence within those mites. 

After mite quantities and species were recorded, a representative sample of eriophyoids putatively identified as *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* had their identity verified with the acarologist, Dr. Sam Bolton of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Plant Industry (FDACS-DPI) to ensure accuracy.

Roses which appeared to show symptoms of Rose Rosette Disease, or which had populations of *P. fructiphilus* present were tested by the Plant Disease Diagnostic Clinic at the NFREC. Plant tissues were tested for Rose rosette virus by Dr. Fanny Iriarte using the currently accepted molecular methods described in @Babu2016, @Babu2017a, and/or @Babu2017b. 


#### 2.1.5 Potential benefits
Florida is the largest producer of roses with a total value exceeding $30 million, and stands to lose millions of dollars if RRD and *P. fructiphilus* become established. At this point, it is critical to develop action plans to control eriophyid mites on roses. By conducting this survey and finding *P. fructiphilus* and RRD in the Florida landscape, we can determine the severity of the situation and inform growers who are in areas of greater risk. Informed nurseries can then take actions to protect their ornamentals from mite infestation, and can be vigilant for RRD symptoms. 

#### 2.1.6 Expected outcomes

Potential outcomes of the mite surveys are fourfold: 

- Detect the range of *Phyllcoptes fructiphilus* and/or Rose Rosette Disease in northern Florida

- Identify native predatory mites with bio-control potential

- Identify other possible vectors of RRD

- Detect other mite species of concern on Florida roses

Our results will help identify areas with greater disease risk for *P. fructiphilus* and/or RRV.

Overall, we believe that the various objectives of this proposal will answer fundamental questions regarding the potential spread of *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* and Rose Rosette Disease (RRD) in Florida. RRD has been found without the mite, and now we may have found the mite without the pathogen at different parts of the year. This suggests that *P. fructiphilus* and RRD have potential to become established in Florida. This research would be a first step in the development of preventative measures against RRD in Florida and will have direct practical outcomes that could be implemented in the short term to protect Florida production of roses.
