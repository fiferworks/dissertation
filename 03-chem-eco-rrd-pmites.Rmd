# CHANGES IN HEADSPACE VOLATILES FOR RRD-INFECTED ROSES {#chemeco}
## Introduction {#intro-chemeco-swirskii}
Rose Rosette Virus (RRV) genus *Emaraviridae* is the the casual agent of Rose Rosette Disease (RRD), the most severe disease of roses [@Laney2011]. RRD is thought to have invaded the southeastern United States by the movement of its vector, the eriophyid mite, *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* Kiefer (Trombidiformes: Eriophyidae), on multiflora rose (*Rosa multiflora* (Thunb)), as these organisms expanded their range from the US northwest, south and east towards the coast [@Amrine2002; @Otero-Colina2018; @Solo2020]. RRD is currently present throughout the US, and has been recently detected in Florida (@Fife2020, see *\@ref(survey-map-3)*). Infection with RRD creates witches’ brooms, rosetting, deforms flowers, increases prickle density, elongates shoots, reddens of plant tissues, causes dieback and ultimately plant death. Few management options are available to manage *P. fructiphilous*: Current mite control is achieved by removing infected roses and frequent pesticide applications [@UGA2018; @Olson2017; @Hong2012]. Growers are interested in alternative management options to combat *P. fructiphilus* and RRD. Predatory mites have potential to fulfill this need: Mites from the family Phytoseiidae 


Nursery managers are interested in alternative and less expensive management options to combat *P. fructiphilus* and Rose Rosette Virus. Predatory mites have potential to fulfill this need: Mites from the family Phytoseiidae are being investigated as biocontrol agents for the management of *P. fructiphilus*. Preliminary data suggest that the phytoseiid mite *A. swirskii* is attracted to volatiles of Rose Rosette-infected roses. This attraction may have synergistic effects for *P. fructiphilus* control. *A. swirskii*  This research will contribute testing the suitability of *A. swirskii* as a biocontrol option for the management of *P. fructiphilus*.

## *Amblyseius swirskii* attraction to RRD-infected roses {#intro-swirskii}

Phytoseiids rely heavily on VOCs to orient themselves towards their prey and potential mates, while avoiding predators [@Gnanvossou2003].

Preliminary data suggest that the phytoseiid mite *Amblyseius swirskii* Athias-Henriot (Mesostigmata: Phytoseiidae) is attracted towards volatiles of RRD-infected plants.

<!-- Phytoseiids also attracted to synthetic MeSA in lab [@Gadino2011], But lures had mixed results @Gadino2012 -->

Phytoseiid mites have no eyes, instead relying on plant volatiles such as Methyl Salicylate to guide them to their prey [@Boer2004a]. Methyl Salicylate is also released when a plant is attacked by herbivores or pathogens [@Boer2004a; @Shulaev1997], so when preliminary tests with *A. swirskii* showed attraction to RRV-infected roses, coupled Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy analysis was expected to reveal high levels of Methyl Salicylate. Contrary to expectation, RRV-infected roses had low levels of Methyl Salicylate compared to healthy plants. This suggests that phytoseiid attraction may be attributed to volatiles besides Methyl Salicylate. This is important because such volatiles may be used to lure phytoseiids to eriophyid-infested areas, encouraging feeding and enhancing pest control [@Boer2004a; @Boer2004b]. Understanding which volatiles are responsible for phytoseiid attraction to RRV-infected roses will provide preliminary research which impacts management options for *P. fructiphilus* in southern Georgia/northern Florida as well as other *P. fructiphilus* & RRV-infested regions. 


When under attack by pathogens or herbivores, plants release volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) into their environment

Predatory mites react to plant volatiles in various ways: VOCs can increasing prey-seeking behaviors and sometimes help to lure predators to their prey [@Boer2004a; @Boer2004b]. Chemical lures such as Methyl Salicylate (MeSA) can also encourage local recruitment of nearby mites and other natural predators [@Boer2004a; @Boer2004b], which can contribute to control of other pests of roses. Predatory mites are not considered to be environmentally-damaging or a health concern. Phytoseiid mites are compatible with some pesticides and other biocontrol methods, and feed on many different agricultural pests as well, so they can integrate well with existing pest management programs. Developing a biocontrol option for RRV can also increase profitability for rose growers not only by reducing losses from RRV-infection, but by reducing the number of pesticides which need to be applied. Reducing grower's reliance on pesticides has multiple benefits, promoting the health and safety of growers as well as protecting the environment. Reducing pesticide usage can also prevent *P. fructiphilus* from developing pesticide resistance and decrease risks for pollinators which frequent roses. Predatory mites are low-maintenance to rear and deploy and subsist in the environment without decreasing sustainability in other areas. Overall, predatory mites represent great value for sustainable agriculture.

Salicylic Acid plays a role in activating a plant's immune system and helps protect the plant from pests, bacteria, fungus or viruses [@Gozzo2013]. We are collaborating with the University of Georgia to test how activating plant defensive compounds might protect roses from *P. fructiphilus* and/or RRD. We applied Acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM), a chemical which works like Salicylic Acid to activate plant defenses [@Ziadi2001; @Tripathi2010] at a high and a low rate, as well as a miticide and water as controls. These data suggest that activated plant defenses may work to control *P. fructiphilus*.

Some mites orient themselves towards volatiles of their prey or the host plant of their prey. We intend to investigate differences between RRV-infected and uninfected Pink Double Knock Out® roses and their volatiles, as well as the effects of SAR-induction on rose volatiles. The results will help inform future assays involving predatory mites and their *P. fructiphilus*-seeking behaviors in relation to rose RRV-infection status and the use of SAR-inducers for biological control.

Predatory mites do not feed on the plants they live on, so they shouldn't be harmed by activated plant defensive compounds. In natural systems, predatory mites learn to follow plant defensive chemicals to find their prey [@Boer2004a]. This suggests that combining ASM-activated plant defenses with predatory mites may enhance the ability of predatory mites to find their prey, but this combination hasn't been tested yet.

We plan on collecting plant volatiles from Double Knock Out® roses and comparing the differences between RRV-infected and uninfected roses, using a push-pull volatile collection system as illustrated in *\@ref(fig:vol-extract)*. Filtered air fills an oven bag sealed over rose canes to trap leaf volatiles. Volatiles are then drawn through a clean collection filter by a vaccuum. The chemicals on the filter are eluted with 150 \si{\micro\liter} of dichloromethane, then 5 \si{\micro\liter} of nonyl acetate are added as an internal standard to the extraction. The extractions then are injected into a GC-MS and their spectra are analyzed. Compounds are identified by comparison to mass spectra databases as well as synthetic standards for confirmation.

By determining which chemicals change during infection or with SAR-induction, we can gain insight into the physiological changes occuring during RRV-infection and SAR-induction in roses. Testing headspace volatiles can also give us insight into what VOCs predators like *A. swirskii* may encounter on infected or SAR-induced roses.

- Determine which headspace VOCs are different between RRV-infected and healthy roses

- Determine what effects SAR-induction has on RRV-infected and healthy roses

- Creates a starting point for volatile testing for future olfactometer studies with *A. swirskii*

Knowing which VOCs affect the host-seeking abilities of a predatory mite like *A. swirskii* is part of preliminary work for determining the compatibility of *A. swirskii* as a predator of *P. fructiphilus*.

Volatiles from 20 roses will be collected before treatments as a baseline (already collected). Then half of the plants will be SAR-induced by bi-weekly spray applications of Acibenzolar-S-Methyl. Subsequently, half of the remaining plants (5 control and 5 SAR-induced plants) will be grafted with RRV-infected buds to innoculate them with the virus [@Doudrick1987]. Volatiles will be collected bi-monthly following SAR-induction and RRV application.  


There will be differences in Methyl Salicylate between each group of roses: SAR-induced plants will have the most, RRV-infected roses will have the least, indicating changes in plant chemistry during RRV-infection. Other chemicals, particularly those associated with plant defenses, follow similar trends, and vary from group to group, but we have little preliminary data on this. By determining which chemicals change during infection or with SAR-induction, we can gain insight into the physiological changes occuring during RRV-infection and SAR-induction in roses. Testing headspace volatiles can also give us insight into what VOCs predators like *A. swirskii* may encounter on infected or SAR-induced roses.

### Two arm olfactometer assays {#mm-olfact}
*Amblyseius swirskii* Athias-Henriot will be reared according to procedures adapted from @Sarwar2017: *A. swirskii* mites will be reared in growth chambers set at 25 &deg;C with 70\% RH and 16:8 hours light:dark. Colonies will be kept in vermiculite-filled plastic containers, which will be suspended on plastic pylons in a moat of water with a surfactant to break the surface tension, preventing mite escape. Colonies will be fed every 2 days with bee pollen.

1. We will analyze differences in headspace VOCs extracted from both RRV-infected and uninfected roses using paired Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and preform a Principal Component Analysis to determine which compounds are good candidates for testing *A. swirskii* attraction.

1. We will record the reponses of *A. swirkii* mites with two-arm olfactometer assays to determine the attractiveness to the selected compounds and analyze the results using \\chi-squared tests.

1. If there are significant differences in *A. swirskii* attraction towards single compounds or blends with Y-tube assays, we will preform a series of tests with four-arm olfactometer assays to compare *A. swirskii* choices between different attractive compounds.


1. Count the number of mites which choose to walk towards volatiles from RRV-infected roses rather than the control (untreated filtered air) with two-arm olfactometer assays analyzed using [@appropiatestaticalmethod] tests. Mites which significantly choose RRV-infected rose volatiles over the control will be considered "responsive" and used for further assays.
1. Measure amounts of headspace volatiles extracted from both RRV-infected and uninfected roses. Paired Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry will measure the quantity and determine the types of volatiles released using [@appropiatestaticalmethod] tests.
1. Count the number of responsive mites which choose to walk towards synthetic volatile blends rather than the control (untreated filtered air) with two-arm olfactometer assays analyzed using [@appropiatestaticalmethod].
1. Count the number of responsive mites which choose to walk towards synthetic volatile blends rather than volatiles from RRV-infected roses or controls (untreated filtered air) with four-arm olfactometer assays analyzed using [@appropiatestaticalmethod].
1. Compare populations of *P. fructiphilus*, phytoseiid mites and RRV infection in field trials in Griffin, Georgia with randomized block experiments comparing synthetic lures to controls without lures and analyzing data with [@appropiatestaticalmethod].
