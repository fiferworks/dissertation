# CHANGES IN HEADSPACE VOLATILES FOR RRD-INFECTED ROSES {#chemeco}
## Introduction {#intro-swirskii-vocs}
### Rose Rosette Disease, predatory mites and plant defenses: Why are *Amblyseius swirskii* attracted to infected roses? {#intro-swirskii}
Rose Rosette Virus (RRV) genus *Emaraviridae* is the the casual agent of Rose Rosette Disease (RRD), the most severe disease of roses [@Laney2011]. RRD is thought to have invaded the southeastern United States by the movement of its vector, the eriophyid mite, *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* Kiefer (Trombidiformes: Eriophyidae), on multiflora rose (*Rosa multiflora* (Thunb)), as these organisms expanded their range from the US northwest, south and east towards the coast [@Amrine2002; @Otero-Colina2018; @Solo2020]. RRD is currently present throughout the US, and has been recently detected in Florida [@Fife2020]. Infection with RRD creates witches’ brooms, rosetting, deforms flowers, increases prickle density, elongates shoots, reddens of plant tissues, causes die-back and ultimately plant death. Few management options are available to manage *P. fructiphilus*: Current mite control is achieved by removing infected roses and frequent pesticide applications [@UGA2018; @Olson2017; @Hong2012]. Nursery managers are interested in alternative and less expensive management options to combat *P. fructiphilus* and RRD. Predatory mites may have potential to fulfill this need [@Gerson2014; @Carrillo2015; @Farragut2010; @Gerson2003]: Many predatory mites species have been successfully integrated into pest management programs along with other biocontrol agents [@Freitas2021; @Bouagga2018; @Chow2010; @Midthassel2016], and certain pesticides [@Trumble1993; @Nicetic2001; @Fernandez2017]. Predatory mites from the family phytoseiidae live in close association with their host plants and are effective predators of many pest species [@Carrillo2015; @Farragut2010; @Gerson2003]. One of the most popular species of commercially-available phytoseiid mites is *Amblyseius swirskii* Athias-Henriot (Mesostigmata: Phytoseiidae)[@Calvo2014]. *A. swirskii* are considered to be a generalist species which feed on a variety of different arthropod pests [@McMurtry1997], including eriophyoid mites [@Park2010; @Park2011]. *A. swirskii* are able to be purchased in slow release sachets and safely shipped to growers that need them [@Calvo2014; @Lopez2016a; @Buitenhuis2014]. They are commonly used in biological control programs [@Calvo2014], partially because of their ability to survive on alternative food sources when pests are not present [@Nguyen2013]. They are also able to be released before pests arrive [@Kutuk2011], surviving on banker and native plants in the environment until pest populations increase [@Xiao2012]. This intimate relation with plants extends into the realm of chemical communications: Phytoseiid like *A. swirskii* have no eyes, instead relying on plant Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) to guide them to their prey [@Nomikou2005; @Boer2004a; @Gnanvossou2003]. Many plant VOCs are released when a plant is attacked by herbivores or pathogens [@Halitschke2007; @Sabelis1999; @Shulaev1997], the composition of which varies, depending on the plant species and type of damage/infection [@Maeda2006; @Qualley2008; @Boom2004; @Sabelis1999]. Methyl Salicylate (MeSA) is a VOC commonly produced under many types of pathogen attack [@Arimura2011; @Park2007]. This plant volatile is derived from Salicylic Acid (SA), an important plant hormone involved in activating the hypersensitive response to pathogens [@Vlot2009; @Park2007; @Gaffney1993; @Goodman1994]. Volatilized MeSA can initiate the the signalling pathway which primes a plant's immune system against attacks by pathogens [@Conrath2006; @Tieman2010; @Shulaev1997; @Gozzo2013]. Activation of these plant defenses creates long term resistance against future pathogen attack throughout the plant, through a mechanism known as systemic acquired resistance (SAR) [@Zhang2010; @Boller2009; @Vlot2009]. These same pathways can be induced in a plant by chemical analogues to SA, such as the benzothiadiazoles, including acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) [@Darolt2020; @Ziadi2001; @Tripathi2010; @Narusaka1999]. Inducing SAR can have various positive effects on disease prevention: SAR induction is often used to combat fungal diseases [@Suo2001; @Narusaka1999; @Xue1998; @Goy1992], and some studies have found that SAR induction and the hypersensitive response can disrupt the establishment of eriophyoid mites [@Bronner1991; @Bronner1991a; @Westphal1991]. Infested plants produced \textbeta-1,3-glucanase and chitinases, which were hypothesized to contribute to defenses against these eriophyoid mites [@Bronner1991a; @Ward1991a]. Similar increases in \textbeta-1,3-glucanase and chitinase activity was seen in roses treated with ASM, restricting the growth of a fungal pathogen [@Suo2001]. This suggests that SAR-induction in roses may have biological activity against eriophyoid mites, including *P. fructiphilus*. Unfortunately, inducing SAR can have negative effects on herbivores as well as predators [@Pappas2017; @Ataide2016; @Kant2015], which necessitates careful study of all organisms involved to create a successful pest management program. Our study was designed to investigate some of the interactions between plant volatiles and their effects on predatory mites: Preliminary data suggest that *A. swirskii* are attracted towards volatiles of RRD-infected plants. Similarly, MeSA has been reported to attract phytoseiid mites towards their prey to varying degrees of success [@James2004; @Boer2004a; @Boer2004b; @Gadino2011; @Gadino2012]. We hypothesized that infection with RRD was triggering the release of MeSA, creating *A. swirskii*'s attraction to the infected plants. Our studies were designed to investigate differences between RRV-infected and uninfected Pink Double Knock Out® roses and their volatiles, as well as the effects of SAR-induction on rose volatiles. The results will help inform future assays involving predatory mites and their prey-seeking behaviors in relation to rose RRV-infection status and the use of SAR-inducers for biological control of *P. fructiphilus*.


## Materials & Methods {#mm-vocs-olfact}
### Collection of headspace volatiles from roses {#mm-vocs}
Two methods for collecting headspace volatiles were explored, Volatile Collection Traps (VCT) and Solid Phase Micro Extraction (SPME).

#### Volatile collection trap method {#mm-vct}
The VCT method of collecting VOCs was based on a push-pull volatile collection method as illustrated in *\@ref(fig:voc-qsep)*. Filtered air was provided by a 4-Port Positive Pressure Flow Out/Dual Y-Tubes & Volatile Collection System (Sigma Scientific, Micanopy, FL USA) at 0.2 \si{\litre}s/min. Air was blown through a teflon tube into a nylon oven bag (GoBeGreen Turkey Oven Bags, GoBeGreen, Los Angeles, CA, USA.) that had been dried in an  over at 50 &deg;C overnight. The bag would be sealed over the end of a flowering rose cane from from Pink Double Knock Out® roses. Bags were allowed to inflate in order to detect excessive leaks, if no large leaks were detected, the corner of the bag would be cut and a VCT would be inserted. Traps were 3.5” with 28 ± 5 \si{\milli\gram} 80/100 mesh with HayeSep® Q adsorbent (Sigma Scientific, Micanopy, FL USA). Headspace volatiles were drawn through the filter by a vacuum line operating at 0.1 \si{\litre}/min. Bags were left at positive pressure during volatile collection for 24 hours. The VOCs adsorbed inside the VCT filter were then eluted with 150 \si{\micro\litre}s of dichloromethane into a glass headspace vial, then 5 \si{\micro\liter} of 1 \si{\micro\liter}/\si{\gram} Nonyl Acetate were added to each solution as an internal standard. A baseline of 53 headspace VOC extractions were collected from 20 mite-free, one-year-old, uninfected Pink Double Knock Out® roses growing in 3 gallon buckets, 16:8 Light:Dark cycles. 4 extractions were completed from graft-inoculated RRD-positive roses [@Doudrick1987], grown in a quarantine greenhouse under similar parameters. Headspace samples of the RRD-infected roses were taken prior to the quarantine measures requested by federal agencies. Samples were taken at ~20 &deg;C and RH 50-66\%.

#### Solid phase micro extraction (SPME) method {#mm-spme}
The Solid Phase Micro Extraction (SPME) field method was created to overcome a specific study limitation: shortly after the detection of *P. fructiphilus* in Florida, NFREC researchers were restricted from working with RRD-infected plants by state agencies to prevent the introduction of the virus to the mites found in the region. In order to obtain VOCs from RRD-infected roses, extractions were taken *in situ* from roses in the landscape of Athens, GA *\@ref(fig:voc-spme)*. The SPME procedure was similar to the VCT method with a few exceptions: Oven bags were left over rose canes and flowers for an hour before extraction would begin. Filtered air was provided by a Kobalt 24v cordless high-volume inflator (Lowe's, Mooresville, NC, USA) attached to a inline carbon block filter (Clear$_2$O® RV and Marine Inline Water Filter - CRV2006, Miramar, FL, USA). Air flow was adjusted to 0.2 \si{\litre}/min with a variable flow meter (Sho-Rate™ Series Glass Tube Variable Area Flow Meter, model 1350CB1F, Brooks Instruments, Hatfield, PA, USA) and blown through a teflon tube into an oven bag surrounding the rose flowers and canes to agitate the headspace VOCs. An edge of the oven bag was removed and a disposable air filter/check valve inserted to prevent the oven bag from bursting due to over pressure. Once the bag was in place, an aluminum rod with burette holder/clamps was driven into the ground near the rose to be sampled, and the manual SPME injector (Supelco, Inc, Sigma-Aldrich, Bellefonte, PA, USA) clamped so that the needle of the fiber holder could pierce the inflated bag. Before VOC extraction, 1 \si{\micro\liter} of Nonyl Acetate was added to the bag as an internal standard. Extractions were done for 20 minutes. Injections were done using 24 Ga Stableflex SPME fibers with 50/30 \si{\micro\meter} DVB/CAR/PDMS coatings (Supelco, Inc, Sigma-Aldrich, Bellefonte, PA, USA). For SPME sampling, headspace VOCs were collected from 11 untreated roses from *P.fructiphilus*-infested roses in the landscape of Tallahassee, FL. 8 roses from the same location were treated with Actigard® 50WG (Syngenta, Greensboro, NC, USA), (ASM) 100 \si{\milli\gram}/\si{\liter} for 12 weeks before sampling, and 11 RRD-infected roses were sampled from three locations in Athens, GA on May 28th, 2021. Plants were of unknown age, growing in full sun, with symptoms of RRD. The daily temperature of the day of extractions ranged from 24-31 &deg;C, RH 46-74\%.

#### Analysis of headspace data {#mm-voc-analyze}
Headspace extractions from VCT and SPME were injected into a paired Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) (ThermoFisher Trace 1310 Gas Chromatograph and ThermoFisher ISQ QD Single Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer, (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) and their spectra were analyzed with Chromeleon™ 7 Chromatography Data System software (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts). GC-MS Injections were for 38 mins with 5 &deg;C increase per minute. Volatile collection equipment was cleaned according to manufacturer's instructions. Compounds were identified by comparisons of mass spectra to spectral databases for confirmation. The ratio of the area under the curve for each chemical peak was then divided by the area of the internal standard (Nonyl Acetate). These values were used for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with the factoextra package [@Kassambara2020a], and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) [@Konopka2020a] in R version 4.1.1 [@RCT2021], to visualize any clustering of data and to determine which VOCs are of interest. 
<!-- The first three samples of VCT uninfected rose data was averaged for the comparison to the four infected rose samples in order to balance the data. -->

### Two-arm olfactometer assays {#mm-olfact}
*A. swirskii* mites were purchased online as mini sachets with hooks (Ambly-S, Arbico Organics, Oro Valley, AZ, USA). Sachets would be emptied into a plastic container before assays in order to facilitate finding mites. The mite colony was fed every 2 days with bee/pine pollen. Filtered air was provided by a 4-Port Positive Pressure Flow Out/Dual Y-Tubes & Volatile Collection System (Sigma Scientific, Micanopy, FL USA) at 0.3 \si{\litre}s/min for each arm of the Y-tube olfactometer. Air was humidified by passing air through a gas washing bubbler flask filled with water. The bubbler flasks were placed inline before volatile sources and the arms of the Y-tube. The olfactometer was held vertically with a lab stand, and illuminated with a 60 watt household 5000K white LED lightbulb. One arm of the Y-tube would be labelled as the experiment side, and the other arm would be the control chemical. Air lines would be switched after every 5 assays to avoid side bias in the Y-tube. After every 10 assays, the Y-tube was switched for a clean one. Individual *A. swirksii* mites were transferred to the mouth of the Y-tube olfactometer using a fine tipped paintbrush. Assays were recorded for 5 minutes. If a mite entered midway into the arm of an olfactometer, the time and label of the tube would be recorded, the mite removed, and the assay would end. Mites which failed to do so were considered to have made 'no choice' and were removed. Assays with roses involved bagging the roses as previously described, but with outlet air lines connected to the inlet of one arm of the Y-tube. In this manner, comparisons were made between an empty bag of air and a healthy rose, as well as uninfected roses to RRD-infected roses. Synthetic volatiles were selected from the top ten chemicals seen in the contributions table from the PCA analysis (*\@ref(tab:spme-contrib-table), \@ref(tab:qsep-contrib-table)*). Assays of synthetic volatiles were conducted by a selected VOC with dicholoromethane. The solution was then applied to a 3 \si{\centi\metre} dental wick. Dental wicks were placed in otherwise empty inline gas washing bubbler flasks, and left for 5 minutes before beginning an assay. The synthetic VOCs MeSA and DL-Limonene at were tested, at a concentration of 1 \si{\micro\gram}/\si{\micro\liter}. 100 \si{\micro\litre} of dicholoromethane was used as a control.

Responses of *A. swirkii* were compared with $\chi^2$ tests using R version 4.1.1 [@RCT2021].


## Results {#results-vocs-olfact}
### Volatile differences between infected, healthy and induced roses {#results-vocs}
The top six contributing VOCs for VCT were \textgamma-Murrolene, \textbeta-Ocimene, (E,E)-\textalpha-Farnesene, \textbeta-Caryophyllene, Methyl Salicylate and \textbeta-Pinene (*\@ref(tab:qsep-contrib-table)*). The top six contributing chemicals for SPME were \textgamma-Murrolene,	\textbeta-Caryophyllene 1R-\textalpha-Pinene, Mesitylene, \textbeta-Pinene and m-Xylene (*\@ref(tab:spme-contrib-table)*). Roses infected with RRD were generally similar to uninfected roses for both VCT and SPME methods, (*\@ref(fig:qsep-vocs-compares)*, *\@ref(fig:spme-vocs-compares)*, *\@ref(fig:qsep-vocs-umap)*, *\@ref(fig:spme-vocs-umap)*), but ASM-treated roses had less chemical variance than either group (*\@ref(fig:spme-vocs-compares)*, *\@ref(fig:spme-vocs-umap)*). For VCT samples, \textgamma-Murrolene explained most of the variance in uninfected roses, while SPME samples showed the opposite:\textgamma-Murrolene and \textbeta-Caryophyllene were primarily found in infected roses.

### *A. swirskii* attraction to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) {#results-olfact}
*A. swirskii* were not significantly selective for MeSA at the concentrations we used, but mites were significantly more likely to make choices when testing with roses. DL-Limonene created more choices than other treatments. (*\@ref(fig:aswir-mesa-lim)*). Choices for DL-Limonene vs. control and Filtered Air vs. Healthy Roses were not significantly different, but *A. swirskii* mites were significantly more attracted to RRV-infected roses.

## Discussion {#dis-vocs-olfact}
Plants play a large role in the lives of phytoseiid mites [@Schmidt2013; @Cortesero2000]: for example the trichome density of plants affects their dispersal [@Loughner2010; @Loughner2010a; @Lopez2016; @Buitenhuis2013], oviposition, [@Agrawal1997; @Walter1996; @Grostal1994; @Walter1992; @ODowd1991], performance as predators [@Buitenhuis2013; @Seelmann2007; @Cedola2001] and their ability to avoid predation [@Faraji2002]. Therefore, it is not unusual to see a preference towards plant VOCs, but it is interesting to note their attraction to an infected rose (*\@ref(fig:aswir-rrd)*). Future tests should try varying the concentrations of these chemicals, and testing the other chemicals detected from the volatile extractions. Olfactometers are considered a useful way to determine predatory mite attraction to different prey items [@Janssen1990], so it is possible that infected roses release volatiles that *A. swirskii* would associate with prey. It is interesting to note that VCT methods found that levels of MeSA were lower for infected plants; SPME methods did not recover MeSA. It may be that SPME fibers were not exposed to VOCs long enough on infected roses to reach equilibrium, or MeSA is very low in severely infected plants. It is also peculiar to see that MeSA levels were not recovered from ASM-treated plants (*\@ref(tab:spme-contrib-table), \@ref(tab:spme-corr-table)*). ASM induces SAR, again possibly that SPME fibers may not be adsorbing MeSA in our assays for some reason. Furthermore, ASM-treated plants had lower volatile activity overall, compared to other roses, which may explain the clustering we see in our figures (*\@ref(fig:spme-vocs-compares)*, *\@ref(fig:all-vocs-umap)*). Another possibility is that the time of sampling affected the outcome. ASM-treated plants were sampled at the end of a 12-week application period, by which it may no longer be producing MeSA at high levels. This is an unfortunate side effect of sampling in the field at a remote site rather than in the lab. The SPME method is limited to short extractions, partially due to overheating of the inflator pumps. It is harder to have high confidence about results without VCT validation, due to the many variables and possible confounding effects such as plant age, measurement error, sample contamination, temperature, etc.. Sampling recently SAR-induced plants with VCT methods would give a good point of reference to resolve this discrepancy. If MeSA levels are truly low on infected roses, it may suggest that MeSA was not the primary chemical involved with attracting *A. swirskii* to roses. The most common VOCs extracted from roses were terpenes. \textgamma-Murrolene and \textbeta-Caryophyllene were the largest contributors to the VOC composition from the roses collected, so it would be worth testing these chemicals with *A. swirskii* to see if these chemicals play a role in *A. swirskii* attraction to infected roses. Mites were not more attracted to Limonene than filtered air in our preliminary trials, but there were differences in time to choice (*\@ref(fig:aswir-mesa-lim-times)*) and a significant difference between making a choice vs. no choice (*\@ref(fig:aswir-mesa-lim)*). On the contrary to the Limonene results, *A. swirskii* appeared to have random behaviors between choices and no-choice, and did not vary in their time to choice (*\@ref(fig:aswir-mesa-lim)*, *\@ref(fig:aswir-mesa-lim-times)*). We predict that reducing the concentrations of these synthetic VOCs may produce different responses, more experiments are warranted. In conclusion, we have found preliminary data about volatile changes in infected roses and SAR-induced roses, and their putative relationships with *A. swirskii*.
