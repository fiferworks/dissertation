<!--
Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of 
metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!
If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete the section entirely, or silence them (add # before each line). 
If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.
If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this.
If you receive a duplicate label error after knitting, make sure to delete the index.Rmd file and then knit again.
