The invasive <em>P. fructiphilus</em> is the vector of <em>Rose rosette emaravirus</em> (RRV), the causal agent of Rose Rosette Disease (RRD), the most serious disease of roses. Infection with RRV produces elongated shoots, increased prickle density, witches brooms, deformed flowers, reddened plant tissues, dieback, and ultimately kills the host plant. Few management options are available: mite control is primarily achieved by rouging and frequent pesticide applications. Growers are interested in alternative and less expensive management options to combat this mite and virus. Little information is known about this plant pathosystem. In order to learn more about mite-plant-virus associations in the field, surveys of mites on roses was conducted from 2019-2021, along an east-west transect in northern Florida, searching for RRD, <em>P. fructiphilus</em>, predatory mites, and other mites on roses in the landscape. As a result of these surveys, <em>P. fructiphilus</em> were detected for the first time in Florida, but no RRD was detected. <em>P. fructiphilus</em> represents a potential threat to the Florida rose industry if RRD becomes established. Headspace volatiles of <em>P. fructiphilus</em>-infested roses were examined in the field. These results informed investigations into tritrophic effects of induced plant defenses on <em>P. fructiphilus</em> and <em>Amblyseius swirskii</em>, a predatory mite which is being investigated for its biocontrol potential in ornamental crops. We also describe the first detection of <em>Orchid fleck dichorhavirus</em>, orchid infecting subgroup (OFV-Orc) infecting three unreported ornamental hosts: <em>Liriope muscari</em>, cv. 'Gigantea', <em>Ophiopogon intermedius</em> and <em>Aspidistra elatior</em> in Leon and Alachua Counties, FL. Over 50 plant species can become infected with OFV-Orc, including plants from the Orchidaceae, Asparagaceae (Nolinoidaea), and Rutaceae, where infection causes citrus leprosis-like symptoms. We encountered the flat mite on OFV-Orc-infected plants, <em>Brevipalpus californicus</em> (Banks) <em>sensu lato</em>, which is a known vector of this virus. Coinfections of two different OFV-Orc strains were detected in both counties. Florida has many plants in the landscape threatened by these mite-plant-virus pathosystems, each of which represent a risk for economic losses for the ornamental plant industry in the southeastern US.
