# Integrated Pest Management of *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus*

### Introduction

<!-- slow release sachets which are sheltered and provided with felt patches and and moisture in the form of water-absorbant sodium polyacrylate gels had better release of predators [@Shimoda2018] -->

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is the combination of science-informed best practices designed to keep the cost of pest control below the value of the crop damages which would occur without intervention (i.e. economic injury level) [@USDA2018]. In practice, IPM is informed by an understanding of the pest's biology and the judicious use of chemical controls, natural predators (biological controls), plant breeding, plant immune systems and physical (cultural) controls as needed to control pests as efficiently as possible.

*Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* Keifer (Trombidiformes: Eriophyidae) is a microscopic plant-feeding arachnid known as an eriophyid mite. *P. fructiphilus* is host specific, only feeding on plants in the genus *Rosa*, and normally cause little damage by itself. Unfortunately, *P. fructiphilus* has become infamous due to Rose Rosette Virus (RRV), a pathogen which the mite transmits while feeding. RRV infection creates the following symptoms: witches' brooms/rosetting, deformed flowers, increased prickle density, elongated shoots, reddened leaves and stems, and increased die-back which ultimately kills the rose host. This disease is known as Rose Rosette Disease (RRD) and is widely considered the most serious disease of roses in the US. RRD and the mite have invaded the southeastern US as they followed the range expansion of the non-native *Rosa multiflora* (Thunb) towards the coast [@Amrine2002; @Otero-Colina2018]. RRD afflicts a passionate group from different sections of the US rose industry, including homeowners, commercial landscapers, nurseries, conservationists, and rosarians, all of whom stand to lose millions of dollars and many established roses plantings in the coming years. Florida, as the nation's largest producer of roses, has a special interest developing methods to better control *P. fructiphilus* and RRD.

There is a critical need to improve management of *P. fructiphilus* and RRD. Unfortunately, few commercially available roses have resistance to RRD [@Byrne2018; @Bello2017]. Presently, growers are recommended to manage the *P. fructiphilus* by removing plants and spraying pesticides [@UGA2018; @Olson2017; @Hong2012]. However, pesticides have come under increased public scrutiny due to concerns about health, the environment, pest resistance, and harm to pollinators [@Alavanja2004, @Fenner2013, @Croft1988, @Vanbergen2013]. Increased pesticide applications also decrease grower profits and reduce competitiveness with foreign markets. The lack of alternative or complementary management options exacerbates this issue: rose growers need more options for *P. fructiphilus* control, especially methods which can be integrated into existing management programs.

In 2013, nursery workers in Quincy, Gadsden County, Florida, USA, detected unusual red growths, deformed stems and extra thorniness on 15 knockout roses which had been imported from out of state. Eight symptomatic plants were tested by our Plant Diagnostic Clinic at the University of Florida's North Florida Research and Education Center in Quincy, FL, and found to be positive for RRD, but the *P. fructiphilus* mites were not detected at that time [@Babu2014]. 

Since then, nurseries, rosarians, landscapers and shareholders have expressed concerns about the possible introduction of RRD infestations from areas where the disease had become established, including the neighboring states of Georgia and Alabama [@Solo2020].

Our experiments focus on a major obstacle to controlling RRD: Eriophyid mites like *P. fructiphilus* are hard to control via conventional methods (i.e. pesticides) due to their small size and their cryptic habits. *P. fructiphilus* hide in tight spaces such as rose sepals and petioles, and under glandular plant hairs [@Bauchan2019; @Otero-Colina2018]. This means that management which relies on contact with the pest is unlikely to reach these mites under normal circumstances.

Our lab hypothesizes that predatory mites can circumvent this problem and combat *P. fructiphilus* in situ. Predatory mites in the family Phytoseiidae can manage a variety of agricultural pests [@Gerson2003; @Carrillo2015], and some species are small enough that they may be able to find and feed on *P. fructiphilus* in their hiding places (Carillo, personal communication).

In 2017, some researchers suggested a southern limit for RRD and *P. fructiphilus*, based on a series of surveys they had conducted in the Eastern US [@Solo2020]. The suggested boundary was thought to be caused by some unknown environmental factor(s), such as climate, pathogens, lack of a suitable host, or natural enemies in the landscape, which limited the range of RRD and *P. fructiphilus*. Unfortunately, these surveys had not included Florida, possibly due to constraints on time and/or resources.

As part of the efforts to develop novel mite management methods, our lab has leveraged its experience with chemical ecology to conduct a series of preliminary two-choice maze (Y-tube olfactometer) trials with various species of commercially-available predatory mites. In these trials, mites are exposed to chemical odorants which are correlated with the pest arthropod, such as samples droppings or sheds of the pest, a substrate which the pest has walked on, eggs of the pest, or plants which have been attacked by the pest. Attraction to these odorants is usually suggestive of predatory mite feeding preferences, and is a fast way to judge their potential for use in biological control [@Janssen1990].

While testing the compatibility of our rose system with various commercially-available predatory mites, we were excited to observe that *Amblyseius swirskii* Athias-Henriot (Mesostigmata: Phytoseiidae) mites were attracted towards roses which were infected with RRD (see *`r citef("rose_vols")`*). This was encouraging because *A. swirskii* are generalist predators which feed on other common agricultural pests such as whiteflies [@Bolckmans2005], spider mites [@McMurtry1970], and thrips [@Wimmer2008], so there is good cause to believe that these mites could feed on eriophyid mites. *A. swirskii* can also persist on pollen [@Loughner2011; @Delisle2015] and other arthropods even when the pest of concern is absent [@Janssen2015]. This allows *A. swirskii*  to be released as a preventative measure instead of reacting to an outbreak [@Kutuk2011]. Furthermore, phytoseiid mites integrate well into pest management programs and are compatible with certain pesticides [@Trumble1993; @Nicetic2001; @Fernandez2017] and other bio-control agents [@Midthassel2016]. Lastly, predatory mites are able to locate their prey in tight areas when other predators might be too big. These features make *A. swirskii* an interesting option for managing *P. fructiphilus*, where conventional methods are undesireable or unavailable.

Asterisks represent significant differences as calculated by &chi;-squared contingency table tests for given probabilities. N.S. = not significant.

These results compelled us to further investigate the differences between the chemical odorants (headspace volatiles) released from RRV-infected and uninfected roses using coupled Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy analysis (GC-MS). The GC-MS data revealed that RRV-infected roses had low levels of an important plant hormone known as Methyl Salicylate (MeSA). MeSA typically increases during an immune response, such as when a plant is attacked by herbivores or pathogens [@Boer2004a; @Shulaev1997]. We expected high levels of MeSA in these infected roses, because they were in the middle of experiencing a pathogen attack, but contrary to this expectation, we found low levels of MeSA emitted from the RRV-infected roses. MeSA is also known to be an attractive odor to some many predatory mites, which use MeSA to locate their prey [@James2004, @Gadino2011, @Boer2004a], and are often attracted to the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) released when plants are injured by pests or infected with pathogens [@Boer2004b]. Our results suggest that either *A. swirski* are attracted to very low levels of MeSA, or perhaps this attraction is caused by other plant chemical cues besides MeSA. Either way, identification of these VOCs gives us insight into how RRD influences the prey-seeking behaviors of *A. swirksii*, which has implications for how effective predatory mite biocontrol will be.

The most interesting part about discovering these low levels of Methyl Salicylate is the role which MeSA typically plays in pathogen resistance [@Kalaivani2016, @Park2007]. MeSA is derived from the phytohormone Salicylic Acid [@Tieman2010], a chemical involved when inducing a plant’s immune response, known as Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) [@Gozzo2013; @Gaffney1993]. SAR protects plants from fungi, bacteria and viral pathogens when induced and affects all tissues in the plant [@Kachroo2013, @Ryals1994]. Low levels of MeSA suggest that RRV interferes with the rose's ability to defend itself against the pathogen. A possible way to avoid this negative feedback loop is to use Salicylic Acid to induce SAR *before* RRV infection, a procedure which would increase the rose's resistance to pathogens before exposure [@Gaffney1993, @Kalaivani2016].

In light of this knowledge, we collaborated with the University of Georgia in to test how SAR-induction might protect roses from *P. fructiphilus* and/or RRD. Acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) is a SAR-inducing chemical which works like Salicylic Acid to induce plant defenses against viruses and bacteria [@Takeshita2013, @Cole1999, @Ziadi2001; @Tripathi2010]. ASM application also has shown chitinase activity in roses [@Suo2001], which may interfere with feeding by herbivorous mites. We tested its efficacy against mites in field trials conducted at Griffin and Athens, GA, sites with low and high *P. fructiphilus* pest pressure, respectively. We tested ASM alongside a different a SAR-inducer (SP2700, Trade name 'Ninja', SePro) and combined one of the SAR-inducers with predatory mites to observe any synergistic effects. We used a miticide as a negative control and water as a positive control. (see *`r citef("ipm")`*). Combining predatory mites with a SAR-inducer was as effective as the miticide alone, and controlled herbivorous mite populations more than either SAR-induction or predatory mites alone (see *`r citef("ipm")`*).

All products were applied at their label rates for 12 weeks. Flower cuttings were be taken weekly to record the numbers of herbivorous mites.")`

Our results suggest that SAR-induced plant defenses have the potential to manage populations of *P. fructiphilus*, especially when integrating SAR-induction with predatory mites. A remaining concern is the effect that SAR-induction has on predatory mite releases: although predatory mites do not feed directly on plants, they may still be harmed via direct and indirect effects of SAR-induction [@Ataide2016, @Pappas2017]. We assert that this less-explored area merits further research in order to optimize the integration of predatory mites with SAR.

Rose Rosette Virus (RRV) is a lethal emaravirus (Emaraviridae) vectored by *Phyllcoptes fructiphilus* Kiefer as it feeds [@Laney2011; @Allington1968]. RRV creates a condition known as Rose Rosette Disease (RRD), with the following symptoms: witches' brooms/rosetting, deformed flowers, increased prickle density, elongated shoots, reddened leaves and stems, increased die-back and ultimately rose death. 

RRV and *P. fructiphilus* are widely distributed in the US, and

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is the combination of science-informed best practices designed to keep the cost of pest control below the value of the crop damages which would occur without intervention (i.e. economic injury level) [@USDA2018]. In practice, IPM is informed by an understanding of the pest's biology and the judicious use of chemical controls, natural predators (biological controls), plant breeding, plant immune systems and physical (cultural) controls as needed to control pests as efficiently as possible.

Currently, no roses are known to resist *P. fructiphilus* and few roses show signs of resistance to RRV [@Bello2017]. Horticulturists manage the disease by removing sick plants and spraying pesticides in an attempt to kill the mite vector. Pesticides are under increased public scrutiny due to concerns about health, the environment, and harm to pollinators.

Acaricide applications are expensive, and eriophyid mites may develop resistance to acaricides with increased applications [@Omoto1995]. 

Overall, rose growers need better methods to combat *P. fructiphilus* and RRV.

Our preliminary data have revealed quantitative and qualitative differences of headspace volatiles between RRV-infected and uninfected roses, including Methyl Salicylate (MeSA). MeSA is derived from the phytohormone Salicylic Acid (SA) [@Tieman2010], a chemical involved in inducing a plant’s immune response, known as Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) [@Tripathi2010; @Tieman2010; @Kalaivani2016; @Gozzo2013; @Gaffney1993]. MeSA typically increases during an immune response [@Shulaev1997], but we found low levels emitted from infected roses. We intend to investigate if we can detect early RRV - infection by monitoring these differences in MeSA and related volatile emissions over time.

Phytoseiid mites such as *A. swirskii* are predatory mites which are commercially available and have been used successfully in agriculture for pest control [@Smith1991; @Onzo2012; @Buitenhuis2015]. Phytoseiid mites integrate well into pest management programs and are compatible with certain pesticides [@Trumble1993; @Nicetic2001; @Fernandez2017] and other bio-control agents [@Midthassel2016].

*A. swirskii* are generalist predators which feed on other agricultural pests such as whiteflies [@Bolckmans2005], spider mites [@McMurtry1970], and thrips [@Wimmer2008]. *A. swirskii* can persist on pollen [@Loughner2011; @Delisle2015] or other arthropods in the field even when the pest of concern is absent [@Janssen2015]. This allows *A. swirskii*  to be released before the targeted pest is present [@Kutuk2011]. Predatory mites do not feed on plants and so are not likely to be affected by ASM applications. This suggests that we may be able to combine predatory mites with our ASM applications to increased pest control. These features make *A. swirskii* and similar mite species an attractive option for IPM, but their potential to control *P. fructiphilus* has not yet been investigated. We intend to observe predatory mite behavior and chemical ecology with choice tests, prey consumptive rates, olfactometer assays, and field releases to determine which species provide optimal control of *P. fructiphilus*.

Another facet of IPM is the plant immune system itself. SAR can be induced before microbial attack to increase a plant's resistance to future microbial attack [@Gaffney1993, @Kalaivani2016]. Acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) is a functional analog of SA, which induces SAR [@Ziadi2001; @Tripathi2010]. Preliminary studies have shown that ASM might prevent RRV progression in roses. ASM application also has shown chitinase activity in roses [@Suo2001], which may interfere with feeding by *P. fructiphilus*. We intend to test how ASM affects RRV progression and *P. fructiphilus* survival.


Integrated pest management (IPM) techniques may have the potential to address some of the shortcomings of current control methods [@citation]. All viable combinations of chemical and biological control are used in IPM to reduce pest populations to below the economic injury level of the crop in question [@citation]. By not relying on a single product or method for pest control, IPM is thought to  delay or prevent the development of pesticide resistance [@citation]. 


A major aspect of integrated pest management in crops relies on the plant's natural defenses [].

innate immune system [@Nurnberger2004]. Plants naturally have resistance genes which protect plants against certain pathogens [@Grennan2006], as well as as suite of pathogen/microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/MAMPs) which are able to recognize parts of invasive pathogens which are not present in plants, such as flagellar proteins [@Nurnberger2004]. Plants respond to pathogen detection with the activation of signalling pathways [@Biere2013; @Gozzo2013]. The type of biochemical response is multivariate, based on the pathways involved and the species of plant in question [@citation], but activation of an immune response ultimately results in a variety of biophysical/biochemical changes in plant physiology, such as the thickening of cell walls or production of antimicrobial agents, proteins, reactive oxygen species and other defensive compounds [@Jones2006; @Chisholm2006; @Kachroo2013].



The most well-studied hormones known for triggering plant immunity are Jasmonic Acid, Ethylene, and Salicylic Acid [@Thomma2001].

These signalling pathways respond to particular types of pest and pathogen attacks, and many of the pathways overlap or interact with one another in both complementary and antagonistic ways. 


Activation of the Salicylic Acid pathway causes a plant defense response known as known as Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) [@Gozzo2013]. SAR can protect a plant from becoming infected, but SAR can also be activated before infection to increase a plant's resistance to future microbial attack [@Gaffney1993, @Kalaivani2016]. This is done by exposing plants to chemicals similar to Salicylic Acid (SA), a defensive phytohormone which initiates the signalling cascade for SAR [@Gaffney1993].

## Inducing Systemic Acquired Resistance with Acibenzolar-S-Methyl to reduce populations of *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* {#ipm-actigard}
Acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) is a functional analog of SA, which is able to induce SAR[@Ziadi2001; @Tripathi2010]. ASM is currently used by growers to protect plants from fungal infection [@Ziadi2001; @Tripathi2010]. ASM application has shown chitinase activity in roses [@Suo2001] and preliminary studies have shown that ASM might prevent RRV progression in roses (Babu et al., submitted). Mites have an exoskeleton comprised of chitin [@Nuzzaci1996a], suggesting that rose chitinases affect *P. fructiphilus*'s ability to feed or grow on SAR-induced plants. We intend to test how ASM affects RRV progression and *P. fructiphilus* survival by testing two rates of an ASM-based SAR activator on mite populations in areas with high pest pressure in Georgia. Our hypothesis is that there will be fewer *P. fructiphilus* on plants treated with Actigard when compared to the water treated control group.

#### 4.1.4 Materials & Methods
**Roses**
This will be a 12-week experiment conducted from August to October simultaneously in Griffin, GA and Athens, GA.
Each site will be given 48 Pink Double Knock Out® Roses (Star Roses and Plants, West Grove, PA, USA) which will be planted in 1 gallon buckets filled with potting soil and mixed with granular slow-release fertilizer. Plants will be placed on black plastic mulch and be watered weekly with overhead impact sprinklers.

**Mites**
*Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* are present in the landscape of Georgia. Tissue from RRD-infected roses will be placed onto roses during the first week and 5th week

**Spray rates**
We will be applying the Acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) based Actigard50WG® (Syngenta AG, Basel, Switzerland), at two different rates: 50 mg/L (Half rate) and 100 mg/L (High rate) to observe the effects of inducing Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) on *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* Kiefer. We will have two field sites in Georgia with local populations of *P. fructiphilus*: Griffin GA and Athens, GA. The tests in Griffin will have two controls for chemical applications in this experiment: The first will be the miticide Kontos (Bayer CropScience LP, Cary, NC, USA), at the label rate as a positive control and the second will be water as a negative control. The tests in Athens will have a control of untreated roses as well as water as a negative control.

**Data Collection**
Rose/rosebud cuttings ~10 cm will be taken from each plant before the first treatment to determine the initial populations of *P. fructiphilus* on the roses. We will then take a subset of samples from each rose treatment weekly, rotating samples until each rose plant has been sampled three times. We will also collect samples from all roses at the end of the trial. This experiment will be repeated for two seasons. Rose samples will be placed in 50 mL centrifuge tubes and refrigerated or frozen until floral samples can be processed. Samples will be processed using the washing methods of @Monfreda2007, eriophyoid mites will be counted and identified as previously described.

## 4.2 Integrating Pest Management Methods to control *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* {#ipm-trials}

#### 4.2.1 Problem Statement

#### 4.2.2 Proposal: We propose testing various pest management treatments including predatory mites to reduce populations of *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus*

We propose testing two different SAR-inducers as well as predatory mites for their ability to reduce populations of *P. fructiphilus*. We also intend to combine the effects of predatory mites with a SAR-inducer to determine if these treatments are compatible. All testing will be done in areas with high pest pressure in Georgia. Our hypothesis is that there will be fewer *P. fructiphilus* on plants treated with the SAR-inducers when compared to the water treated control group, and even fewer mites found on plants treated with the combination of a SAR-inducer and predatory mites.

#### 4.2.3 Materials & Methods
  Our studies are designed to investigate if predatory phytoseiid mites such as *A. swirskii* can be combined with roses’ natural systemic activated resistance (SAR) to manage populations of the plant-parasitic mite, *P. fructiphilus*, the vector of Rose Rosette Virus (RRV). Our findings will be used to develop Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs for *P. fructiphilus* management.

<!-- #### Rationale -->

<!-- #### Proposal:  -->

**Roses**
This will be a 12-week experiment conducted from August to October simultaneously in Griffin, GA and Athens, GA.
The Athens site will be given 96 Pink Double Knock Out® Roses (Star Roses and Plants, West Grove, PA, USA), while Griffin will use 54 roses due to the smaller plot area available. Bare root roses will be planted 2 months before the trials begin to allow new flush to form. Rose planting media and environmental conditions will be the same as previously described.

**Mite Infestation**
*Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* are present in the landscape of Georgia. Rose cuttings ~10 cm will be taken from roses showing symptoms of Rose Rosette Disease in the landscape and placed in each rose pot on the 1st, 5th and 9th week of the experiment.

**Predatory mites**
  
*Amblyseius swirskii* mites will be applied on the 1st, 5th and 9th week of the experiment. These mites are deployed from polyethylene fiber sachets containing live colonies of *A. swirskii* and a mite which they consume for food. There is a small hole at the bottom of these sachets which allows the mites to be slowly released into the environment.

**Field Treatments**
  
1. Water - Control
1. Actigard - 100 mg/L
1. Ninja - label rate
1. Kontos - label rate
1. *A. swirskii* (one sachet per rose treated)
1. *A. swirskii* + Ninja (one sachet per rose treated, label rate)

**Data Collection**

Georgia collaborators will be collecting flower samples from all roses once before beginning the treatments on week 1 and once at the end of the experiment on week 12. For weeks 2 through 11, Georgia collaborators will collect flower samples starting from the top rows of each block every week, until each row has been sampled three times (see *`r citef("ipm_athens")`* and *`r citef("ipm_griffin")`*). Georgia collaborators rate disease severity for each rose every week before they spray, rating roses according to the Horsfall-Barratt Scale [@Horsfall1945]. Roses displaying symptoms of RRD will have tissues sent to the Plant Disease Diagnostic Clinic at the North Florida Reasearch and Extension Center(PDC) for virus confirmation.

**Sample Processing** 

- A flower cutting of about ~12 cm will be take and placed the flower petal side down into 50 ml centrifuge tubes filled with 15 ml of 95% ethanol so the entire flower is submerged over the sepals. Once the lid is is secure, the the tube will be shaken vigorously for a few seconds to help dislodge any mites. Samples will be processed using the washing methods of @Monfreda2007, eriophyoid mites will be counted and identified as previously described.

**Plot Design - Athens**
  
The site at Athens, GA has space for five blocks: A, B, C, D and E. Each block is a 3 $\times$ 6 plot with 18 plants, with three plants in each treatment. The experiments will be run for 12 weeks. We will be sampling flower cuttings from two rows each week, starting with the top rows (1-15 and 16-30 for week one) of each block and rotating to the next row each week (31-45 and 46-60 on week 2) continuing until all rows have been sampled three times. In order to avoid confusion, each rose pot will be labeled with a stake that has the plant number and treatment abbreviation: (W, A, K, M, N, +) written on it. Applications will be done on the same day each week, weather permitting, preferably at the beginning of the week.
