## A small introduction to the Acari {#acari}

Mites and ticks belong to a subclass of small arachnids known as the Acari, an incredibly diverse group of arthropods. Despite their ubiquity, mites and invertebrates in general remain understudied relative to other animal fauna [@Grodsky2015; @Rosenthal2017; @Titley2017]. @Hoy2011 speculates that our understanding of mite diversity and abundance may be around 50-100 years behind the taxonomy of the Insecta: The small size and cryptic habits of mites make them easy to overlook, and difficult to observe. In addition, their disputed placement in the Arachnida [@Giribet2018] presents a real challenge for taxonomists [@Giangrande2003]. Lastly, many mite species have been missclassified, and cryptic species make taxonomic certainty elusive [@Bickford2007]. In spite of these impediments, technological improvements, such as Low-Temperature Scanning Electron Microscopy [@Achor2001; @Wergin2006], Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy [@Chetverikov2012; @Chetverikov2012a], X-ray computed tomography [@Dunlop2011; @Facchini2019], and advances in molecular biology--including high-throughput sequencing--[@Dasch2019], have helped to alleviate the pains of mite identification. The combination of these techniques allows for greater taxonomic certainty [@Chetverikov2012a].

## Herbivorous mites

The most well known species of mites have gained scientific recognition primarily due to their pest status [@Jeppson1975; @Hoy2011; @Savory1964]: many acari are parasites of plants and animals, causing disease and economic injury [@Walter2013; @Jeppson1975; @Hoy2011]. Even so, the majority of mite species are of no economic importance, and are harmless, or even beneficial: many show promise as biological control agents for weeds and arthropod pests [@Carrillo2015; @Gerson2003]. Although the majority of arachnids are predatory, mites are unique in that there are species which feed on plants [@Savory1964]. Phytophagy arose at least seven times in the Trombidiformes: Parasitengonae, Tetranychoidea, Raphignathoidea, Heterostigmata, Eupodoidea, Tydeoidea and Eriophyoidea all have species which feed on plants [@Lindquist1999]. Phytophagy is thought to be a facultative development for the majority of mite taxa outside of the Tetranychoidea and Eriophyoidea; few species of Eupodoidea and Raphignathoidea are obligate herbivores--only *Halotydeus*, *Penthaleus* (Raphignathoidea: Penthaleidae) and *Eustigmaeus* (Raphignathoidea: Stigmaeidae [@Gerson1971])--and the other mite groups have few morphological adaptations associated with plant feeding [@Lindquist1999; @Krantz1979]. An important development in the evolution of acarine phytophagy is the reduction of the chelicerae into sharp stylets used for piercing plant tissues [@Lillo2018]. These styliform mouthparts are thought to reduce damage to the plant in order to avoid some of the toxic chemistry plants use to defend themselves from arthropod feeding [@Brattsten1986]. Herbivorous mite damage is dependent on the specific mite-plant interactions for a given plant spp. or cultivar [@Petanovic2010]. Mites generally feed on plant epidermal and mesophyll cells [@McCoy1996; @Rancic2006]. High mite populations can reduce the amount of chlorophyll available to the plant [@Khederi2018a], primarily causing bronzing/russetting/silvering by direct feeding, but this damage often spreads to the surrounding tissues as the plant's immune system responds [@Bensoussan2016]. Mite salivary secretions can also cause a condition known as toxemia, which causes plant tissues to become chlorotic or discolor [@Oldfield1996]. Feeding on young tissues often forms distortions and delays plant growth, and some mites--many eriophyoidea and two spp. of Tenuipalpidae--form galls on their host plants [@Jeppson1975; @Westphal1996; @Oldfield2005]. The majority of herbivorous mites do not transmit pathogens [@Oldfield1996a], but those which do act as vectors of plant viruses principally from two families from the Prostigmata: Eriophyidae and Tenuipalpidae [@Slykhuis1965]. Members of these mite superfamilies are obligate herbivores considered to be some of the more ancient lineages of phytophagous mites [@Lindquist1999]. Although there have been singular reports of spider mites--tetranychidae--associated with viruses [@Slykhuis1965; @Robertson1988], other studies have failed to reproduce similar results [@Granillo1974]. Plant mites are generally considered secondary pests, but often cause significant losses when conditions are optimal, due to the fast reproductive rate of many pest species [@Gerson1989; @Dutcher2007]. Although the development of phytophagy can be considered an evolutionary advantage for the Acari, it puts the interest of these minute arachnids in direct conflict with the interests of modern agriculture, and motivates the need for management of mite populations to avoid reaching a crop's economic injury level [@Stern1959].

## In-depth With the Plant Specialists: The Eriophyoidea
The eriophyoidea are the second most economically-important group of herbivorous mites, right behind Tetranychidae. Where eriophyoids lose out in damage output, they pull ahead in diversity: It is estimated that the 2,838 species reported in the "Catalog of the Eriophyoidea of the World" represent only about 10% of the total number of species which exist [@Amrine1994]. Publications of new species descriptions of eriophyids averaged about 70 per year from 1996 to 2007, and have greatly increased since the publication of *Eriophyoid Mites -- their Biology, Natural Enemies and Control* [@Lindquist1996], a landmark publication for the field of eriophyoid studies. Eriophyids range in size from 80-500 \si{\micro\metre} long [@Nuzzaci1996], and seem to have evolved specifically for plant feeding [@Krantz1979; @Oldfield1996a; @Lindquist1999; @Skoracka2010; @Lillo2018]: they have evolved styliform chelicera covered with a protective sheath [@Lindquist1999; @Bolton2018], elongate vermiform bodies, and have a reduced number of legs from the typical eight to four [@Lindquist1996a]. The stylets of eriophyids are short, $\le$ 20 \si{\micro\metre} [@Oldfield1996a], which primarily limits their feeding to epidermal cells. Eriophyoid mites also have an abbreviated lifecycle, progressing from egg, to protonymph, followed by deutonymph, then adult, skipping the tritionymph stage [@Manson1996]. Many eriophyoid mites have summer forms (protogynes) which readily proliferate and winter forms (deutogynes), which are able to survive harsher conditions until they can disperse when environmental conditions are moderate [@Kassar1990]. Eriophyids are not able to disperse very far by walking [@Calvet2020], but are known to disperse aerially [@Kuczynski2020] and passively [@Galvao2012], rarely by phoresy on other animals [@Li2018]. The majority of eriophyids studied to date are considered host specific, limited to feeding on a single genus, or one host plant. [@Oldfield1996a; @Lillo2018]. The few mite species which appear to have a broader host range may be misidentified cryptic species [@Navia2012; @Skoracka2013], a hypothesis strengthened by their limited ability to disperse and close associations with their host plants [@Magalhaes2007]. Eriophyid mites represent the majority of mites involved in virus transmission to plants [@Oldfield1996a, @Lillo2018]. In the absence of an infectious agent, most damage from the feeding of vagrant forms of eriophyids is superficial and causes minimal damage to their host plant [@Oldfield1996a; @Krantz1979]. To date, eriophyids have only been associated with plant viruses [@Lillo2018], which may be explained by the small size of eriophyoid mouths and foreguts, which preclude the acquisition and circulation of large pathogens [@Oldfield1996a].

*Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* Keifer, (Trombidiformes: Eriophyidae) is an eriophyoid mite from the Prostigmata group. *P. fructiphilus* grows from egg to adult in 11 days [@Kassar1990].

## The Tetranychoidea
The mite superfamily Tetranychoidea is comprised of 2,000 species divided into 5 families [@Krantz2009], two of which have economic significance, Tetranychidae--the spider mites--and Tenuipalpidae. Tenuipalpidae are known colloquially as the false spider mites, or flat mites due to their flattened character and superficial similarity to tetranychidae. In contrast to tetranychids, tenuipalpids do not spin webs and are considered to be a pest of reduced severity: @Krantz2009 places them as the 'third most important family of phytophagous mites'.

### 1.2 Rose Rosette Virus and Rose Rosette Disease {#lit-review-rrv}
Like many other eriophyoids, the relationships *P. fructiphilus* has with its host and virus are very specific [@Oldfield1996a; @Krantz1979]: *P. fructiphilus* only feeds on plants in the genus *Rosa* (roses) and doesn't create noticeable damage by feeding. An increased interest in *P. fructiphilus* stems from its relationship with a virus known as Rose Rosette Virus (RRV) Emaraviridae [@Allington1968; @Tzanetakis2006; @Laney2011]. 

*P. fructiphilus* transmits RRV while feeding on the rose epidermis [@Allington1968]. Infection creates the following symptoms: clusters of deformed flowers known as rosettes/witches' brooms, increased thorniness, elongated shoots, reddened leaves and stems, and increased cane die-back which ultimately kills the rose host [@Epstein1995]. This disease is known as Rose Rosette Disease (RRD) and is the most serious disease of roses, creating millions of dollars of losses for growers [@Babu2014] and threatening the ornamental rose industry [@Byrne2019, @Rwahnih2019].

RRD was first described in North America in 1941 from an outbreak in Manitoba, Canada [@Conners1941]. *P. fructiphilus* later became recognized as the vector for RRV [@Allington1968; @Doudrick1986; @Jesse2006] and RRV was eventually confirmed to be the casual agent for the RRD [@Doudrick1987; @Tzanetakis2006; @Laney2011; @Dobhal2016; @Bello2015; @Bello2017]. The mite and virus were generally associated with invasive multiflora rose, *Rosa multiflora* (Thunb) [@Amrine1996, @Amrine2002; @Otero-Colina2018] and spread along with the rose throughout the central US [@Crowe1983], and the east [@Hindal1988]. Initially the relationship between *R. multiflora* and the pathogen was considered as a type of natural biological control [@Epstein1999], and some studies even considered artificially spreading RRD to eradicate these pestilent roses [@Tipping2000]. The relationship between, *R. multiflora*, mite and virus also has a positive influence on *P. fructiphilus* fecundity: @Epstein1999 reported a 17-fold increase in the mite population of diseased roses compared to uninfected plants. Like other plant-feeding mites, *P. fructiphilus* reproduce via arrhenotokous parthenogenesis, meaning that unfertilized eggs become male, while fertilized eggs become female. This allows a single female to found a new colony without being fertilized *a priori* to dispersion [@Helle1996].

Together, these factors likely contributed to *P. fructiphilus*'s ability to disperse. RRD and *P. fructiphilus* can spread through the landscape in various ways: RRV can be spread by grafting [@Doudrick1987] and the mites can crawl from plant to plant or be blown by the wind over long distances [@Zhao1997a; @Zhao1997b; @Michalska2009]. Unfortunately, *P. fructiphilus* and RRD have the ability to infest commercial rose cultivars as well [@Byrne2018; @Epstein1995], and can be spread by humans moving infested plants [@Navia2009]. 


### 1.3 Disease Management {#lit-review-management}

Rose Rosette Virus (RRV), the casual agent of Rose Rosette Disease (RRD) and *P. fructiphilus* Kiefer invaded the southeastern United States on the multiflora rose, *R. multiflora* (Thunb) as it spread its range towards the coast [@Amrine2002; @Otero-Colina2018]. RRD is present throughout the US, including Decatur County, GA, near the Florida border (*`r citef("eddmaps")`*), [@EDDMapS2019].


Currently, all roses are known to host *P. fructiphilus*, and few roses show signs of resistance to RRV [@Bello2017]. Nursery managers tentatively control the disease by removing sick plants and spraying acaracides. Acaricide applications are expensive, and eriophyid mites may develop resistance to acaricides with increased applications [@Omoto1995]. In addition, to date there is limited information regarding the toxicity and effectiveness of acaricides used to combat *P. fructiphilus*. Pesticide applications are further complicated by the biology of the mite: *P. fructiphilus* are a refuge seeking species of eriophyoids which prefer to feed on the small plant hairs on the sepals, underneath the petals [@Otero-Colina2018; @Lillo2018; @Jesse2006; @Amrine1994]. The petals help shield the mites from conventional pesticide treatments. Furthermore, a single mite is potentially enough to transmit the virus [@Bello2017], which can infect a rose in less than an hour, yet plants can remain sick and symptomless for months to years [@Amrine1996; @Bello2017]. This slow onset of disease symptoms creates an additional challenge for management [@Bello2017], because by the time the disease is noticed, the mites may have already spread to the whole garden. Disease detection is also difficult: Symptoms can appear similar to natural plant growth or herbicide damage, making it hard to diagnose in the field [@Hong2012]. Molecular methods for testing RRV are becoming readily available [@Babu2016; @Babu2017a; @Babu2017b, @Babu2018, @Bello2017], and newer technologies, such as Raman spectroscopy [@Farber2019] are being developed to test for RRV, but it remains to be seen if these methods are capable of identifying asymptomatic infections or if these tests are suitable for disease monitoring on larger scales. Overall, rose growers need better methods to combat *P. fructiphilus* and RRV.

### Plant defenses and Systemic Acquires Resistance (SAR)

Plants are primarily sessile organisms which aren't able to run or hide when an herbivorous mite attacks it. Instead, plants rely heavily on their ability to protect themselves in-situ, via a myriad of different physical and chemical defenses [@Walling2000]. These defenses are categorized as either constitutive defenses or induced defenses [@Farmer2016]. Constitutive defenses are always 'on', being produced by the plant constantly, such as tannins and latex, while inducible defenses rely on some sort of signal before the plant will produce them. Physical defenses of herbivory includes spines, prickles, thorns, glandular trichomes, latex, sclereids, epicuticular wax, bark, thick cell walls, and compensatory growth to prevent tissue damage while increasing wear on herbivore mouthparts [@Farmer2016]. In addition to these physical barriers to herbivory, plants are also efficient chemical factories which produce a bevy of secondary plant metabolites, including inhibitory proteins, enzymes, and toxins which reduce palatability of plant tissues, prevent uptake of essential amino acids, or kill the herbivore outright [@Farmer2016]. The hypotheses surrounding inducible defenses vary, from considering the costs of resource allocation (Optimal Defense Theory) [@Adler1994] The majority of chemical defenses are inducable in nature [@citation], which permits them to be exploited for laboratory studies and pest management.

There are a number of hypotheses about plant defenses,  to be a trade-off between growth and defense

<!-- Citation describing how SA and JA induction decreased mite numbers [@Khederi2018] -->


Induction of plant defenses can have negative consequences for the herbivores as well as the predators [@Pappas2017]: @Ataide2016 observed that inducing a plant JA pathway reduces phytophagous mite performance, but also negatively affected ovophagy by predatory mites. Also, the predatory mites preferred eggs from herbivorous mites unaffected by the induced plant defenses [@Ataide2016]. This reduction in predation allowed the resurgence of the pest mite later [@Ataide2016].

@Kant2007 found examples of interspecific variation of *T. urticae*'s ability to induce--and resist--JA defenses.

The interaction of SA and JA varies by species, and exhibit negative cross-talk in some plant systems
*Aculops lycopersici* induce SA defenses while suppressing JA pathways, not via antagonistic cross-talk between the responses, but by suppressing downstream accumulation of JA [@Glas2014]. *T. urticae* feeding induces both JA and SA pathways, but when both mites were introduced to the same plant, the JA response plummeted and SA doubled [@Glas2014]. When the mites feed on the same plant, *T. urticae* populations benefit from the reduction of JA caused by *A. lycopersici*, but *A. lycopersici* populations suffer [@Glas2014]. Meanwhile, the effects of increased SA from eriopyhid mite feeding prevented a secondary bacterial infection.

When a plant is attacked by an herbivore and a plant pathogen at the same time, it creates pressure on the plant to defend on two fronts, which is further complicated by the negative cross-talk which sometimes occurs when defenses are induced [@Belliure2010]. This struggle has clear benefits for vectors of plant pathogens [@Belliure2010].

*T. urticae* and *Brevipalpus* suppress plant defenses [@Alba2014; @Arena2018]

Plant cross-talk during the induction of plant defenses is put under pressure when mites and viruses team up? [@Belliure2010]
